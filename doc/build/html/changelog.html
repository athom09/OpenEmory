<p>The purpose of this milestone is to polish the faculty demo prototype, and
to begin to ready the site for template integration by adding features which
appear in the design.</p>
<p><strong>Internal prototype: Not for production release</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When an author is editing article metadata, they can enter co-author names
and select from suggestions (including name and division) from ESD data, so
that they can add correct co-author names without knowing netIDs.</li>
<li>When an author uploads an article, the file type is checked, so that users
cannot upload non-PDF&#8217;s.</li>
<li>When a user is viewing information for an article, they can see the
number of downloads and the number of views for that item, so that both
anonymous users and authors can know the popularity of an article.</li>
<li>When a user is viewing the footer of any page, they can see the total
number of repository items, the total number of items downloaded, the number
of items downloaded this year, the total number of members, and the number
of members currently online, so that users can understand the size of the
community and repository.</li>
<li>On the Search Results page, a user can limit their original search by
filters (facets), so that they can find records limited by Author, Journal,
Subject, or Year.</li>
<li>When a user clicks on a Subject, they are taken to a list of articles
which share that subject, so that they can see research similar to the
article they have found.</li>
<li>On the Search Results page, a user can type into the &#8220;search within
results...&#8221; box, so that they can search again within the results list.</li>
<li>When a user clicks &#8220;OpenEmory at a Glance,&#8221; they can see a page listing
Top 10 Downloads and 10 Recent Additions, so that they can get a sense of
what is being posted, and what is being downloaded, on the site.</li>
<li>When a user clicks the &#8220;Browse by&#8221; navigation tab, they can choose
Author, Subject, and Journal, so that they can browse the scholarship posted
in Open Emory.</li>
<li>When a logged-in user tries to leave the metadata edit form without saving,
they see only one prompt to urge them to save, so that they can decide
whether to save or leave the page.</li>
<li>When an author is choosing a Subject on the metadata edit form, they can
type into a text box with autofill and select the proper choice, so that
they do not have to choose from an unwieldy list of subjects.</li>
<li>When a user mouses over the &#8220;View Abstract&#8221; link in the item list view,
they can see the abstract of the article, so that they can decide whether to
pursue the article.</li>
<li>When an anonymous user clicks the link to the PubMed version of an article,
that version opens in a new tab or window, so that the user can easily
differentiate and return to the Open Emory interface.</li>
<li>When an admin ingests an article from the Harvest Queue, the article
information changes to a link to the article and a link to edit the
metadata, so that they can choose to view and/or review harvested articles
from the same interface.</li>
<li>Admin users can &#8220;publish&#8221; as well as &#8220;save,&#8221; so that administrators can also
change the status of a document to posted.</li>

<h2>Release 0.6.0 - Faculty Demo<a class="headerlink" href="#release-0-6-0-faculty-demo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This milestone is intended to compile various tasks necessary for
producing a faculty demo site. Authors will be able to attach and
specify licensing and embargo information to deposited articles. Tasks
also include automatic recording and display of file information (size
and type) and assigning a permalink to each article, as well as
attaching a cover page to each article. Finally, the workflow for
saving and publishing articles will be fixed per feedback from the
Article Metadata milestone. User stories are somewhat disparate in
nature, but are required for producing a faculty demo.</p>
<p><strong>Demo &#8211; Not for production release</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When a logged in user initiates an article upload they are presented
with a stub &#8220;Assent to Deposit&#8221; check form so demo audience members
understand the feature as it will be implemented at a later date.</li>
<li>When an author is editing article metadata, they can specify an
optional embargo of 6 months, 18 months, or 1, 2, or 3 years (based
on the publication date), so that they can elect to hide deposited
items for a period of time of their own choosing, or mandated by
their publisher.</li>
<li>When a user other than the author or an admin views an embargoed
record, they see a note about the embargo and the date the item will
be available alongside the metadata instead of a full text link, so
that they will understand why they can&#8217;t download the full text.</li>
<li>When a user is viewing an article that was harvested from an
external source with licensing information (such as Creative
Commons) attached, that license information is displayed with the
article metadata, so the licensing information can be determined by
anonymous users.</li>
<li>When an Author ingests an article, it is assigned an ARK, so a
permalink can be generated and the article can be persistently
accessed.</li>
<li>When an anonymous user views the PDF of an Open Emory article, a
cover page precedes the article text, so that any anonymous user can
identify the PDF as being from Open Emory.</li>
<li>A user can save the metadata edit form without filling in all
required fields, so that they can return to finish editing if they
do not know the information contained in a required field.</li>
<li>An Article owner can upload a PDF of the author agreement in the
Metadata edit form so authors and site admins can maintain a
definitive record of the publishing agreement.</li>
<li>When an anonymous user views record information for an article, they
see the file size and type in human readable format, so that they
can understand what they&#8217;re downloading before they do so.</li>

<h2>Release 0.5.0 - Faculty Profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#release-0-5-0-faculty-profiles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This milestone is intended to create basic faculty profiles using Emory
Shared Data for basic directory information. Authors will also have the
opportunity to provide biographical and professional information to augment
their profiles. Authors may supply and edit some profile information at any
time. Authors who have instructed UTS to suppress their information will be
prompted to share some or all of this information through the Open Emory
interface.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Unauthenticated users can visit profile pages for faculty with the
faculty member&#8217;s name, suffix, title, department, school, and list of
uploaded or harvested articles, so that they learn more about the faculty
member and publications.</li>
<li>When an unauthenticated user tries to visit a profile page for a
non-faculty Emory user, they are told that no such profile exists, so
that only Emory faculty members and manually-added users have public
profiles.</li>
<li>When an authenticated user who isn&#8217;t faculty or an admin tries to log in,
their password is rejected and they are treated as if they do not have an
account, so that only Emory faculty members can log in to the system.</li>
<li>When an anonymous user looks up a faculty member who is &#8220;directory
suppressed&#8221; or &#8220;internet suppressed,&#8221; they see the name and Open Emory
data, but no other data imported from the directory, in order to maintain
their privacy and abide by the university&#8217;s privacy policies.</li>
<li>When a faculty member who is &#8220;directory suppressed&#8221; or &#8220;internet
suppressed&#8221; is looking at their profile, they can choose to display their
profile information as if they were not suppressed, so that their profile
page can be populated and displayed.</li>
<li>An authenticated faculty user can add Degrees to their profile, including
name of degree, institution, and year (with suggestions autofilled for
the institution), so that they can describe themselves on their profile.</li>
<li>An authenticated faculty user can add a profile picture in gif, jpeg, or
png format, to their own profile, so that they can display a photo when
others view their profile. If no photo is uploaded, no placeholder image
will be displayed.</li>
<li>An authenticated faculty user can add a biographical paragraph to their
profile, so that they can describe their career in more detail.</li>
<li>An authenticated faculty user can add Positions to their profile, so that
they can identify academic positions as director of an institute or
program not supplied by UTS data.</li>
<li>An authenticated faculty user can add information to their profile on
grants received, including granting agency, project title, and date (with
autofilled suggestions for granting agency), so that they can describe
their career in more detail.</li>
<li>An anonymous user can browse faculty profiles by school and department
and division, so that they can identify Emory faculty members working in
a particular field.</li>
<li>An admin user can edit the profile page of a faculty member or a
pseudo-faculty member, so that admins can maintain and update and support
users.</li>
<li>An admin user can manually create a profile page that looks like a
faculty profile page for a non-faculty member, so that key administration
advocates who do not have faculty status can nonetheless be added to the
repository. That non-faculty user can edit the profile page as a faculty
member would, so that they can display their information.</li>

<div><ul class="simple">
<li>When an author successfully uploads an article, they see a form where
they can edit article metadata before that article is visible to the
public so that they can describe the item correctly before publishing it.</li>
<li>When editing article metadata, an author can specify free text values
for: title, funding groups (multiple), journal title, journal publisher,
volume, issue, page numbers, abstract, author notes, and keywords so they
can describe the item correctly.</li>
<li>An author can click a &#8220;publish&#8221; button to save the metadata form and
populate the record in the repository so that an item record can be
displayed on the website. (Redirect to profile after successful publish).</li>
<li>When an author uploads an article, the type of resource is prepopulated
as text, the file format as PDF, and the genre as article, so that the
items are sharable and identifiable according to the requirements of
MODS.</li>
<li>When editing article metadata, an author can specify co-authors by netid
in order to credit colleagues and share metadata maintenance permission.
The system will automatically assign these authors an Emory University
institutional affiliation.</li>
<li>An author can specify a name (with an optional institutional affiliation)
as a co-author instead of a netid so that they can include non-Emory
co-authors. If they do, then the author name will not be linked to a
profile.</li>
<li>An author can remove a co-author by deleting their name or netid and
saving the form so that they can correct errors.</li>
<li>When editing article metadata, an author is required to specify whether
an article is a pre-print, post-print, or final published version, so
that users know which version of an authoritative peer-reviewed scholarly
article they are downloading.</li>
<li>When editing article metadata, an author can specify the date of
publication, with the year required and the month and day optional so
that users can identify when the article was first published.</li>
<li>When editing article metadata, an author can specify a URL and/or DOI for
the final published version of the article so that readers can access
this version. The URL will be verified when the form is saved.</li>
<li>When editing article metadata, an author can specify additional URLs
associated with the article (PubMed, other repository, etc) so that
readers can find more information about it.</li>
<li>When editing article metadata, an author is required to select a text
language from a drop-down menu in which the first option is English so
that readers can decide whether to download the article. If no language
is selected, the value will default to English.</li>
<li>When editing article metadata, an author can select subject headings
taken from the ETD list of ProQuest research fields to aid searchability.
Use same options and configuration available in ETD&#8217;s, but hide numbers
associated with field names.</li>
<li>When editing an article&#8217;s funding group, journal title, journal
publisher, keywords, or co-author affiliation, an author will be prompted
with suggestions pulled from existing entries to those fields to improve
normalization of data and reduce errors.</li>
<li>When an author is editing an article, they can click a &#8220;save&#8221; button to
save their changes without publishing, so they can revise the record
later.</li>

browser, they will see a warning if they have unsaved changes so they do
not lose their work.</li>
<li>When an author logs in, they will see a list of any unpublished records
on their profile page, so that they can edit and publish those items.</li>
<li>An anonymous user can view a published item record page, populated by the
article&#8217;s full metadata, so that they can decide whether to download it.
This page should include a link to download the article as well as a
permanent id (ARK/DOI) for the article.</li>
<li>When an author publishes an article, it will appear immediately in search
and browse results and on any Emory author profile pages, so that the
article can be viewed immediately.</li>
<li>An admin can view a list of recently published, un-reviewed items, so
that they can select an item to review.</li>
<li>An admin can review and edit a published article, and mark it as
&#8220;reviewed,&#8221; for quality control on metadata. Once an article has been
marked as &#8220;reviewed,&#8221; the author can no longer edit it. Once an article
has been marked as &#8220;reviewed,&#8221; the review event will be recorded (date
and user) and displayed for admins.</li>
<li>Admins will see an edit link for each article in every search, browse,
