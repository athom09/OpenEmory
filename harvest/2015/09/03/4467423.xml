      <abstract>
        <p>Human breast tumors harbor supernumerary centrosomes in almost 80% of tumor cells. Although amplified centrosomes compromise cell viability via multipolar spindles resulting in death-inducing aneuploidy, cancer cells tend to cluster extra centrosomes during mitosis. As a result cancer cells display bipolar spindle phenotypes to maintain a tolerable level of aneuploidy, an edge to their survival. HSET/KifC1, a kinesin-like minus-end directed microtubule motor has recently found fame as a crucial centrosome clustering molecule. Here we show that HSET promotes tumor progression via mechanisms independent of centrosome clustering. We found that HSET is overexpressed in breast carcinomas wherein nuclear HSET accumulation correlated with histological grade and predicted poor progression-free and overall survival. In addition, deregulated HSET protein expression was associated with gene amplification and/or translocation. Our data provide compelling evidence that HSET overexpression is pro-proliferative, promotes clonogenic-survival and enhances cell-cycle kinetics through G2 and M-phases. Importantly, HSET co-immunoprecipitates with survivin, and its overexpression protects survivin from proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in its increased steady-state levels. We provide the first evidence of centrosome clustering-independent activities of HSET that fuel tumor progression and firmly establish that HSET can serve both as a potential prognostic biomarker and as a valuable cancer-selective therapeutic target.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>About 80% of invasive breast cancers exhibit supernumerary centrosomes, a feature commonly referred to as centrosome amplification [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most breast cancers harbor abnormalities in centrosome structure, function, or localization within the cell. These abnormalities can potentially cause cytoarchitectural distortion in cancer tissues with loss of cellular differentiation (anaplasia) via altered centrosome function in microtubule nucleation and organization [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Centrosome amplification can initiate tumorigenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; thus, it is becoming recognized that centrosome amplification is one of the primary causes of breast cancer and is not just a consequence of malignant transformation.</p>
      <p>The presence of more than two centrosomes within a cell can pose a grave conundrum as it may lead to the assembly of a multipolar mitotic spindle, and the production of nonviable progeny cells due to lethal levels of chromosomal loss or gain (i.e., death-inducing, high-grade aneuploidy) [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, cancer cells harboring extra centrosomes circumvent these catastrophic consequences and survive. The secret to their survival and success, as it turns out, lies in a clever tactic that cancer cells use to sidestep spindle multipolarity, viz., centrosome clustering, whereby the excess centrosomes are artfully corralled into two polar foci to enable formation of a pseudo-bipolar mitotic spindle [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During a preceding, transient, multipolar state, merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments occur, thus engendering low-grade whole chromosome missegregation that could be âtumor-promotingâ [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>HSET/KifC1, a minus end-directed motor protein that promotes microtubule cross-linking, sliding, bundling and spindle pole focusing, has been recently identified as an essential mediator of supernumerary centrosome clustering in cancer cells [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HSET has also been shown to be indispensable for the clustering of acentrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) whose production tends to be hyperactivated in cancer cells. HSET knockdown in cells with supernumerary centrosomes causes excess centrosomes to be scattered by pole-separating forces, leading to rampant spindle multipolarity and cell death [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. By contrast, HSET function appears to be non-essential in healthy somatic cells due to the presence of two centrosomes that shoulder the responsibility of bipolar spindle assembly. In cells devoid of centrosomes, such as oocytes, HSET function is indispensable for the assembly of a fusiform bipolar spindle [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Recently, attention has converged on HSET as a potential chemotherapeutic target due to its intriguing association with malignancy. RT-PCR studies have shown that HSET's expression level in lung cancer is associated with increased risk of metastatic dissemination to the brain [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Docetaxel resistance in breast cancer is also suggested to be partly mediated by HSET [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic>In silico</italic> studies reveal that HSET expression is also higher in triple negative breast cancers compared to non-triple negative ones [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The differential dependence of cancer cells on HSET for viability and association of HSET expression with metastases-raise the tantalizing possibility that HSET may play a more important role in tumor progression than previously appreciated. However, more direct evidence of HSET's role in clinical progression of breast cancer and mechanistic studies revealing the molecular circuitry involved therein are lacking.</p>
      <p>In this study, we evaluated HSET expression in breast carcinomas and examined its association with clinical tumor progression. Intriguingly, we found that HSET overexpression at the time of diagnosis was significantly associated with worse prognosis and overall survival. Exploration of its mechanistic role in tumor progression unmasked plausible centrosome clustering--independent roles of HSET underlying enhanced tumor cell proliferation and survival, and disease progression. Our results substantiate the idea that HSET could be an invaluable, cancer-cell selective therapeutic target and may serve as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.</p>

      <sec id="s2_1">
        <title>HSET is overexpressed in variety of human cancers</title>
        <p>Given the crucial requirement of centrosome clustering mechanisms for the viability of cancer cells with extra centrosomes, we first wanted to examine the abundance of the clustering protein HSET in various cancers that harbor extra centrosomes. We performed an <italic>in silico</italic> gene expression analysis using publically-available microarray data to determine the expression level of HSET in various cancer tissue types. One-channel microarray data for glioblastoma, leukemia, lung and breast cancer patients with their normal sample pairs were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Each of these samples were then Robust Multiarray (RMA) normalized [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and their logarithm to base 2-transformed HSET gene expression values were plotted to determine the difference as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ai-vi</xref>. Next, we determined differences in HSET gene expression for cancer and normal sample groups using two-tailed test of hypothesis. Our statistical results indicated higher HSET gene expression in glioblastoma, lung, breast, colon and cervical tumor samples as compared to their corresponding normal tissues. All these tumor types have been shown in various studies with exhibit significant degrees of centrosome amplification [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The average HSET expression for glioblastoma (N=20) and colon cancer (N=53) patients was found to be ~3-fold higher than normal samples (N=3 and 10, respectively) (p&lt;0.005), followed by breast cancer patients (N=179) with more than 5-fold higher expression in tumors than in normal samples (N=16) (p&lt;0.001). Our <italic>in silico</italic> results were consistent with observations from a previous study wherein HSET mRNA expression was significantly elevated in a broad panel of primary tumor tissue compared to corresponding normal tissue [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our <italic>in silico</italic> data corroborate immunohistochemical analysis suggesting a significantly higher HSET expression in glioblastoma, colon and cervical tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Bii, Cii, Dii</xref>) as compared with their respective adjacent normal tissue samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Bi, Ci, Di</xref>). These data suggest HSET overexpression as a general feature of cancers exhibiting significant centrosome amplification.</p>

        <title>HSET is overexpressed in human breast cancers</title>
        <p>Our <italic>in silico</italic> analyses of microarray data showed that breast cancers display significantly higher HSET expression (~5-fold) than corresponding normal tissue. In addition, given the pronounced occurrence of amplified centrosomes and centrosome clustering in aggressive breast cancer, we decided to focus our study on breast cancers. To explore the role of HSET in tumor progression, we examined whether HSET was overexpressed in human breast tumors. We immunoblotted 16 fresh-frozen human tumor samples and their paired adjacent normal tissues for HSET. An enhanced expression of HSET was observed in 10 tumor samples compared to their normal adjacent tissues and 7 representative normal/tumor sample pairs are shown in (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The remaining 6 normal/tumor pairs showed negligible overexpression of HSET (data not shown). Additionally, HSET expression in most human breast cancer cell lines was much higher than in non-cancerous or pre-malignant cell lines such as NIH3T3 and MCF10 series (MCF10A, MCF10AT1, MCF10DCIS) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), indicating that HSET overexpression typifies breast cancer cells.</p>

Amplifications of HSET were visualized as an increase in the number of green signals (denoted as G) relative to the number of red control centromere signals (denoted as R), where 1R1G and 2R2G represent normal HSET gene copy numbers and 1R4G, 2R4G, 2R5G, 1R5G,etc. represent instances wherein HSET gene locus is amplified.

        </fig>
        <p>Since higher HSET protein levels could arise either from an upregulation of transcription from the endogenous locus and/or an amplification of the locus encoding HSET, we decided to examine the copy numbers of the locus encoding the HSET gene in normal and breast tumor tissues. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to directly evaluate HSET copy number per cell in paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissues. We hybridized two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes to primary breast tumor tissues, one from the HSET locus on chromosome 6 (RPCI-11 602P21, green) and one from the chromosome 6 centromere (CH514-7B4, red). Amplification of HSET was visualized as an increase in the number of HSET signals relative to the number of control centromere signals. We scored HSET amplification by FISH in four breast tumor tissues and found that, among them, three tumors exhibited HSET amplifications. No amplification of the HSET locus was observed in the normal adjacent tissues in these samples. We observed various types of copy number changes associated with HSET as shown in (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>). FISH with the centromere probe indicated that most increases in HSET loci were not due to polyploidy of chromosome 6; rather, only 5% of cells were aneuploid. 38% of cells (500 cells each were counted from 2 tissue samples) showed 3 or more copies of HSET paired with only 1 or 2 copies of the centromere (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). More so, cancer cells isolated from fresh human breast tumor also showed HSET amplification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>). These findings indicate alterations in the HSET gene copy number during tumorigenesis. It is worth mentioning that HSET gene amplifications in specific breast tumor samples were correlated with increased expression of HSET protein in all those samples using immunoblotting methods (data not shown).</p>

      <sec id="s2_3">
        <title>HSET overexpression correlates with breast cancer progression and aggressiveness</title>
        <p>Next we asked how HSET overexpression correlates with breast cancer progression and aggressiveness. Using an immunohistochemical approach, we stained a total of 60 clinical specimens with 10 cases each of normal breast, ductal hyperplasia (DH), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS), invasive breast carcinoma (low-grade) and invasive breast carcinoma (high-grade). In consonance with our immunoblotting data, our immunohistochemical analysis showed that HSET is selectively overexpressed in human breast cancers with negligible or absence of expression in normal breast epithelia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed a selective increase in nuclear staining of HSET in tumor samples. Among subtypes based on varying types and extent of intraductal proliferation, we found a progressive increase in HSET nuclear staining intensity and frequency from ductal hyperplasia (DH) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Aii</xref>) to atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Aiii</xref>) to ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Aiv</xref>). In invasive breast cancers (both low- and high- grade), HSET nuclear staining was remarkably intense, with a significant increase in the number of positively stained nuclei per field in high-grade cancers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Av,vi</xref>) compared to low-grade ones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Aii,iii,iv</xref>). A majority of normal breast tissue samples (85%) showed no staining for HSET, while the remainder showed very weak staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Ai</xref>, data not shown). We then calculated a weighted index score (WI) for HSET expression as a product of the staining intensity score (+1, +2, +3) and percentage positive nuclei for each sample. HSET WI serves as an independent measure of the strength of HSET protein expression across all breast tumor specimens. Nuclear HSET WI values were then correlated with normal and tumor samples and also with the grade of tumor samples. Interestingly, nuclear HSET WI showed a strong correlation with increasing tumor grade in breast cancer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Bi,ii</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate robust HSET overexpression in human breast tumors suggesting that abnormal HSET levels correlate with breast cancer development and HSET might play a role in progression of tumors into more malignant and aggressive forms. Having established a significant correlation between HSET expression and tumor differentiation, we next asked if there was an association of nuclear HSET WI with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients, using the biospecimens obtained from Emory Hospital with retrospective clinical information (n=163). While PFS was calculated as the number of days from diagnosis to the first local recurrence or metastasis if one occurred, or the last follow-up if the patient did not progress, OS was based on the number of days from diagnosis to death or last follow-up if death was not recorded. Nuclear HSET WI was also categorized into high and low groups based on the median. Irrespective of the receptor status (n=163), those with higher nuclear HSET WI (shown as HSET WI positive in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Ci,ii</xref>) had significantly shorter PFS (p= 0.0034) and OS (p=0.0412) than patients with lower nuclear HSET WI (shown as HSET WI negative in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Ci,ii</xref>), clearly demonstrating that higher nuclear HSET expression levels significantly correlate with poorer clinical outcomes. Multivariate analysis accounting for HSET nuclear expression, age, grade and receptor status (ER, PR, HER2) revealed that HSET nuclear expression and receptor status (negative) significantly correlated with both OS (p=0.030 for nuclear HSET WI, p=0.036 for PR negativity) and PFS (p=0.044 for nuclear HSET WI, p=0.003 for HER2 negativity). Mean HSET was significantly higher (7.82 vs 5.50, p &lt;.0001) for triple-negative patients as opposed to non-triple-negative patients. In a wound-healing assay, we show that HeLa cells transiently overexpressing HSET show enhanced migration as compared to wild-type HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>). These observations strongly suggest correlation of HSET nuclear expression with breast tumor aggressiveness.</p>

        <title>HSET overexpression is associated with enhanced cell proliferation</title>
        <p>Since elevated HSET expression exhibits a strong correlation with clinical development and progression of cancer, we next asked if high HSET levels had any impact on the kinetics of cancer cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, we used HeLa cells stably transfected with HSET-GFP to examine and compare the levels of various cell proliferation markers in HeLa-HSET-GFP and HeLa cells. Using immunoblotting methods, we found that levels of Ki67 (found in G1, S, G2 and M-phases of the cell cycle but is absent in G0 cells) was substantially elevated in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells compared to wild-type HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This finding was consistent with the strikingly higher Ki67 labeling index observed in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells via immunostaining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This observation is noteworthy since the Ki67 labeling index often correlates with the clinical course of cancer, owing to which the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in a cell population has strong prognostic value for survival and tumor recurrence in cancer patients [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Immunofluorescent staining for BrdU, a marker for cells undergoing S-phase, also showed that a greater proportion of HeLa-HSET-GFP cells were BrdU-positive compared to HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). A visual quantitation of these observations revealed significantly elevated levels of Ki67 expression and BrdU incorporation in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells as compared with HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). We also observed enhanced cdk1 activity and higher expression of phosphorylated histone-H3 in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells compared to HeLa cells, which is indicative of a larger proportion of cells in the HeLa-HSET-GFP line undergoing M-phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). All these lines of evidence strongly advocate for a pro-proliferative role for HSET overexpression in the cellular context of cancer cells. HeLa-HSET-GFP cells also displayed significantly enhanced cell proliferation capacities when compared to HeLa cells in trypan blue assay. Equal numbers of each cell type were seeded on day 0 and were allowed to grow for 2 days (48h), and the number of cells were counted using trypan blue. Based on the data, the doubling time of HeLa-HSET-GFP cells was found to be ~11h as compared to ~16h for HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). We also performed colony formation assay with HeLa cells transiently transfected with control vector, HSET-GFP plasmid and HSET-GFP siRNA. HSET OE cells were able to form significantly higher number of colonies as compared to cells transfected with control vector. Fewer colonies were observed upon HSET knockdown (KD) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>). Similar proliferation effects were confirmed by colony formation assay in another breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 upon transient HSET OE and KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that cells overexpressing HSET display enhanced cell proliferation, and suggest that HSET overexpression may confer significant proliferative advantages to cancer cells.</p>

        <title>HSET overexpression leads to accelerated cell cycle kinetics</title>
        <p>Since HSET OE enhances cellular proliferation in HeLa cells, we were curious to examine any changes in the cell cycle kinetics of cells that stably overexpress HSET (HeLa-HSET-GFP cells) compared to the parental ones. To this end, we synchronized HeLa and HeLa-HSET-GFP cells using a single thymidine block (19h) followed by 2-color flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle profiles of HeLa-HSET-GFP and HeLa cells upon their release from the block at G1/S border. DNA content was analyzed with propidium iodide (PI) staining, where G2/M population was represented by double the intensity of PI (4N) compared to G1 cell population (2N). Anti-MPM-2 antibody tagged with Alexa488 secondary antibody was used to detect a mitosis-specific marker (MPM-2), in order to distinguish between 4N DNA-bearing G2 and M populations. A close interval cell cycle profiling revealed that HeLa-HSET-GFP cells demonstrated faster cell cycle progression kinetics; in other words, the duration of one complete cell cycle was reduced in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells (10.5h) as compared with wild-type cells (13h), with a stark shortening of the G2-and M-phases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B, C</xref>). This experiment was performed 3 times and the average time was represented as final duration of cell cycle phases in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>. This trend was reflected when cyclin B1 levels (indicating mitotic phase) were followed in synchronized HeLa and HeLa-HSET-GFP cells using western blotting. While cyclin B1 levels surged at 10h followed by a decline in HeLa cells, they peaked at 8h and then declined in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Transient knockdown (KD) of HSET in HeLa cells resulted in a marginal increase in cell cycle duration (14h as compared to 13h in HeLa cells) with a protracted G2/M-phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>). This observation is in accordance with previously observed effects of HSET depletion in human fibroblast cells leading to delayed cyclin A degradation [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

        <p>Most often, G1-phase contributes significantly to the cell cycle duration; thus, we sought to determine the effect of HSET OE and KD on G1-phase kinetics. Upon gradual decrease of serum concentration from 10% to 0% over 24h and an additional 12hr serum starvation, transiently transfected HeLa control vector (CV), HeLa HSET OE and HeLa HSET KD cells were replenished with serum-containing medium and stained with â<italic>Cell-Clock</italic>â dye (Biocolor; a redox dye that changes color corresponding to distinct phases in cell cycle). Yellow cells in the culture represent G1 and their color changes to light green in S-phase. We followed the proportion of G1 (yellow-colored) cells from 0h (50-70% G1 enrichment) to 9h after serum replenishment in all the three cases (CV, OE and KD). We observed negligible differences in the proportion of G1 cells in all three conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4Bi, Bii</xref>). This suggests that unlike G2-and M-phase kinetics, HSET OE does not significantly affect the duration of G1-phase.</p>
        <p>Faster kinetic progression of HeLa-HSET-GFP cells (through G2- and M) compared to HeLa cells raised the possibility that G2/M or spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) functions may be compromised in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells. Mad1 is a critical component of the SAC along with Mad2, and an imbalance in the Mad1-Mad2 protein ratio results in a damaged SAC causing premature anaphase entry and chromosome instability [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that HeLa-HSET-GFP cells express markedly higher levels of Mad1 with a distinct nuclear envelope localization compared with parental HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>). This observation along with the known association of HSET with importins, indicate that HSET might be involved in regulating mitotic entry/exit and nuclear export [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. By contrast, there was no significant difference in the levels of Mad2 between the two cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), showing that the Mad1-Mad2 balance is highly perturbed in the HeLa-HSET-GFP cells. Thus we envision that excess HSET directly or indirectly incapacitates the SAC by disrupting the Mad1/Mad2 balance. The HeLa-HSET-GFP cells thus progress through the cell cycle rapidly in the presence of compromised checkpoints, which precipitates a greater likelihood of generating aneuploidy and, thus, may accelerate the process of tumor evolution.</p>

        <p>Our data from the HeLa-HSET-GFP cells demonstrate that HSET OE can markedly accelerate the kinetics of G2 and M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B, C</xref>). Intriguingly, our immunohistochemical data from clinical tumor samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) showed strong nuclear localization of HSET. In order to obtain a deeper understanding of how elevated HSET levels may hasten progression through G2-and M-phases of the cell cycle and to exclude the possibility that faster kinetic progression through the cell cycle may result from artifactual mislocalization of HSET, we decided to examine in detail the sub-cellular localization of this intriguing protein in HeLa cells at various cell cycle stages. We found that HSET is conspicuously confined to the nucleus throughout interphase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>). Our observations are consistent with the finding that the <italic>Xenopus</italic> homolog of HSET, XCTK2, is sequestered in the nucleus in interphase in a Ran-dependent manner via the association of the NLS of XCTK2 with importin Î±/Î² [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In summary, the nuclear localization of the human HSET protein in interphase strongly suggests that the acceleration of the kinetics of G2 may be ascribed to a hitherto unknown activity of HSET within the nucleus.</p>

        <title>HSET overexpression upregulates survival signaling in cancer cells</title>
        <p>Tumor cell numbers and tumor growth are not only a function of rate of cell proliferation but are also crucially influenced by cell survival and/or apoptosis. Having ascertained that HSET OE can enhance the kinetics of cell proliferation in tumors, we wanted to investigate whether elevated levels of HSET have any impact on the status of pro-survival signaling in HeLa cells. Immunoblots showed enhanced survival signaling as evidenced by notably high survivin and p-Bcl2 levels in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) compared with levels seen in parental HeLa cells. To investigate if HSET OE affects signaling pathways that impinge on cell proliferation, or cell survival in breast cancer cells, we compared levels of some key proliferation, hypoxia and cell survival markers in parental MDA-MB-231 cells with MDA-MB-231-HSET overexpressing cells and MDA-MB-231-HSET knockdown cells. We observed enhanced levels of survivin and phospho-survivin, the hypoxia-induced factor HIF1Î±, the SAC protein Mad1 and the mitotic kinase Aurora-B in MDA-MB-231-HSET overexpressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). However, upon HSET knockdown, marginal or no reduction was observed in the expression levels of these proteins as compared with their respective levels in control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). We also observed enhanced Aurora-B kinase activity as well as elevated expression of cyclin B1, D and A upon HSET overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 6A</xref>). The differential effects observed upon HSET OE and KD indicated that HSET may not normally be a key regulator of proliferation and survival pathways. Several studies [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have in fact shown that HSET function is dispensable for the viability of most non-cancerous cells. However, our OE data strongly suggest that an elevated level of HSET expression thrusts proliferation and survival signaling in cancer cells into an âoverdriveâ mode. Using immunohistochemical analysis, we also confirmed that HSET nuclear WI correlated strongly with survivin WI (r=0.68, p=0.05) and Ki67 WI (r=0.32, p&lt;0.001) in clinical samples (n=163). In summary, while HSET plays a non-essential role in regulating survival signaling in cancer cells, HSET overexpression enhances both proliferation as well as survival of cancer cells and perhaps fuels tumor progression by providing cancer cells with a proliferation and survival advantage. Our data thus provide evidence that cancer cells may employ auxiliary pathways/mechanisms, such as those involving the kinesin motor HSET, to their advantage.</p>
        <p>To further explore the physiological role of HSET in cell survival signaling, we assessed the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells with HSET OE or KD to resist UV-induced apoptosis. To this end, we transiently transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with control vector, HSET OE construct or HSET siRNA (~70% transfection efficiency) 24h prior to UV irradiation. Following 10 min exposure to UV-C at 25 J/m<sup>2</sup>, cells were placed in the incubator for apoptosis induction for 5h. Lysates were then collected for determining HSET and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels (an early marker for apoptosis induction) and cell viability was determined using trypan blue assay. Western blot analysis revealed significantly higher cleaved caspase-3 induction in cells with HSET knock-down, whereas cells with HSET OE showed slightly lower cleaved caspase-3 levels as compared to cells transfected with control vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). These data indicate the ability of HSET overexpression to promote cell survival in cancer cells.</p>

        <title>HSET overexpression increases steady-state survivin levels by decreasing its poly-ubiquitination</title>
        <p>Since we observed extensive upregulation of survivin protein expression as a result of HSET OE and significant reduction upon HSET KD, we wanted to determine if HSET occurs in the same protein complex as survivin and whether HSET OE has any effect on the APC/C-dependent proteolysis of survivin.</p>
        <p>First, we tested if HSET and survivin co-immunoprecipitate with each other. We immunoprecipitated HSET from whole cell lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells that carried (i) a control vector, (ii) an HSET OE plasmid, and (iii) an HSET siRNA-bearing construct. Upon probing the immunoprecipitates for survivin, we confirmed that the anti-HSET antibody was able to pull down survivin in all the three cases, with an increased survivin pull down in the cell lysates overexpressing HSET (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Fi</xref>). We also confirmed this association by immunoprecipitating survivin and in turn probing with HSET antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 6B</xref>). These data indicate that HEST binds to survivin either directly or indirectly.</p>
        <p>Since survivin's role in prosurvival signaling is strongly regulated by its degradation via ubiquitination [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we further set out to test the possibility that increased HSET binding to survivin protects survivin from ubiquitination and APC/C-dependent degradation. In MDA-MB-231 cells transiently transfected with control vector, HSET-GFP plasmid and HSET siRNA, we immunoprecipitated survivin and immunoblotted against survivin and ubiquitin. Intriguingly, we observed reduced polyubiquitin signals in HSET overexpressing cells, even though survivin protein levels were extensively overexpressed in HSET overexpressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Fii</xref>) as observed earlier (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). We also observed marginally higher ubiquitin levels in HSET KD cells as compared to control, even though the survivin protein levels were comparable in both the cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Fii</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In recent years, the key role played by the kinesin-14 protein HSET/KifC1 in centrosome clustering in cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes, has been well established. In addition to its mitotic spindle-specific roles, several other roles of HSET requiring or independent of its motor activity have been suggested such as a role in processing early endocytic vesicles [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], rat spermatogenesis [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and active transport of bare double-stranded DNA [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although it is presently unclear whether HSET performs all these functions in cancer cells, these studies bring to light the possibility that HSET's involvement in tumor biology could be multifaceted.</p>
      <p>We (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,B</xref>) and others [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have found that a variety of primary tumors overexpress HSET as compared to their normal adjacent tissues. Several other threads of largely correlative and circumstantial evidence have suggested an involvement of HSET in driving tumor progression and metastases [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, our study is the first to explore and obtain several new mechanistic insights into the pathology of excess HSET in breast cancer cells. We have firmly cemented the hitherto anecdotal evidence with experimental data to show that HSET OE in breast cancer (i) correlates strongly with aggressiveness of the disease, (ii) is attributable, at least in part, to amplification of the genomic locus for this gene, and (iii) promotes tumor cell proliferation by accelerating cell cycle kinetics. Given the myriad of clinical implications of these important findings, our study spotlights the tremendous potential that HSET presents both as a biomarker of tumor progression and as an invaluable cancer cell-specific therapeutic target.</p>
      <p>Four critical observations lead us to believe that HSET might have additional roles in driving tumor progression, independent of its centrosome clustering/spindle pole focusing role in mitosis, viz., (i) elevated ânuclearâ expression of HSET predominantly in the interphase cells within high grade tumors as revealed by immunohistochemical staining suggests that HSET may perform critical mitosis-independent functions in aggressive tumors or plausibly lead to more aggressive phenotypes within tumors; (ii) overexpression of HSET results in accelerated G2- and M-phases. Faster mitoses can conceivably arise from severely compromised SAC function that presumably allows HSET-overexpressing cells to rapidly traverse mitosis in the presence of aberrations including chromosome attachment errors. However, we are aware of the caveat that this mitotic role of HSET does not provide an alibi for the observed faster progression through the G2-phase upon HSET overexpression; (iii) HSET OE in HeLa cells leads to faster cell-cycle kinetics and enhanced overall proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B, C</xref>), and (iv) HSET OE leads to the upregulation of the expression of phospho-survivin, Bcl-2, HIF1Î±, Aurora-B and Mad1, and presumably upregulates the signaling pathways that lie downstream of these key regulatory factors. Furthermore, since fewer than 3% of HeLa cells possess amplified centrosomes (our unpublished observations), we believe that the pro-proliferative role of HSET that we have demonstrated in our study in HeLa cells provides strong evidence for a centrosome clustering-independent activity of HSET.</p>
      <p>To further support the centrosome clustering-independent aspect of HSET's role in driving tumor survival and proliferation, we assessed the effects of HSET OE and KD in HeLa cells with or without centrosome amplification. We induced extra centrosomes in HeLa cells by aphidicolin treatment (20 Î¼M for 48h) and then compared the effect of HSET OE on expression of proliferation/survival markers in the HeLa cell lines bearing normonumerary and supernumerary centrosomes. The fact that we were able to show higher expression of proliferation and survival proteins upon HSET OE in the same cell line regardless of its centrosome status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 7</xref>), asserts the centrosome clustering-independent role of HSET in driving cell proliferation and survival. Our data showed that HSET OE leads to an increase in Mad1 levels without any significant change in the levels of its partner protein, Mad2. Mad1 overexpression in HeLa cells has been shown to disrupt the stoichiometric balance between Mad1 and Mad2 to severely cripple SAC function leading to aneuploidy and chromosomal instability [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We postulate that this surge in Mad1 protein levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>,) facilitates premature anaphase entry by titrating the soluble pool of Mad2 and thereby damaging SAC function, and provides a possible explanation for the speedier execution of mitosis in HeLa-HSET-GFP cells. In addition, our study has yielded several novel mechanistic insights regarding the signaling pathways governed by HSET. Our data indicate that HSET is actually a key member of an oncoprotein axis that includes HIF1Î± and Aurora-B, and controls survival signaling through phospho-survivin and Bcl-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, C, D</xref>). The dysregulation of HIF1Î± and Aurora-B are implicated in many aspects of cancer development and advancement [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Notably, HIF1Î± drives the expression of survivin, which performs a dual function: it is an anti-apoptotic protein that additionally promotes cell proliferation [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Aurora-B is a chromosomal passenger protein involved in chromosome segregation, the spindle checkpoint and cytokinesis [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Aurora-B overexpression, observed in several tumor types [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], has been linked with aggressive metastasis and poor prognosis of cancer patients [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our data thus suggest that HSET OE-driven elevation in HIF1Î± and Aurora-B kinase levels incites upregulation of the pro-proliferative and pro-survival signaling networks and together with the increased aneuploidy triggered by impaired SAC function, facilitates tumor evolution into more malignant forms.</p>
      <p>Importantly, our immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that both HSET and survivin exist within the same complex in MDA-MB-231 cells. We further investigated the molecular and functional significance of HSET's association with survivin and uncovered that HSET binding to survivin protects survivin from degradation by interfering with the latter's ubiquitination. It has been shown that survivin ubiquitination and degradation occurs in the nucleus. We propose that high levels of nuclear HSET inhibit the ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis of survivin in the interphase nucleus of cancer cells. Survivin accumulation is known to increases Aurora-B kinase activity, which in turn,vincrease the endogenous levels of phosphorylated histone H3; clearly, we observe all these effects following HSET OE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thus, we have provided mechanistic evidence that HSET OE, by stabilizing survivin, leads concurrently to both increased cell proliferation and survival signaling.</p>
      <p>A recent study revealed HSET (along with other cell cycle regulated genes) as a transcriptional target of p110CUX1 [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Constitutive activation of p110CUX1 is known to drive cell proliferation by expediting entry into S-phase [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Interestingly, Mad1 is also shown to be transcriptionally regulated by p110CUX1 [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In light of these insights, we are unable to rule out the possibility that HSET nuclear overexpression and upregulation of Mad1 levels are a mere consequence of an upstream regulation by classical tumor promoting genes. The Cux1-E2F-HSET cell proliferation axis thus demands further exploration in order to substantiate the validity of this prospect. Besides, we cannot discount the significance of substantial cell cycle effects observed upon HSET overexpression and the unyielding relationship between HSET nuclear expression and patient survival.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that HSET OE drives tumor progression through multiple mechanisms that include (i) enhancement of tumor cell proliferation rates, (ii) increasing aneuploidy through centrosome clustering, upregulation of Aurora-B and compromised SAC function and (iii) promoting pro-survival signaling. Clearly, these findings that argue for the existence of a causative link between nuclear HSET accruement and tumor aggressiveness, have far-reaching clinical implications, including unlocking the potential of HSET nuclear expression serving as a prognostic biomarker, and HSET taking shape as a cancer-selective therapeutic target for the design and preclinical development of small-molecule HSET inhibitors for non-toxic breast cancer therapy.</p>
