      <abstract>
        <p>The competence of cellular immunity depends on a diverse T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire arising from thymic output. Normal thymopoiesis arises from marrow-derived CD3<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> triple-negative T-cell progenitors (TN), which develop into mature single-positive (SP) CD4 or CD8 T cells after expressing both CD4 and CD8 (double-positive, DP) transiently, leading to <italic>de novo</italic> T-cell production. Interleukin-7 (IL7) is a singularly important common γ-chain IL involved in normal thymic development. Our previous work has demonstrated that γ<sub>c</sub> cytokines fused with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) at the N-terminus acquire unheralded biological properties. Therefore, to enhance thymopoiesis, we developed a novel biopharmaceutical based on the fusion of GMCSF and IL7, hereafter GIFT7. Systemic administration of GIFT7 leads to cortical thymic hyperplasia including the specific expansion of CD44<sup>int</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> double-negative 1 (DN1) thymic progenitors. During murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) infection of aged animals, GIFT7-mediated neo-thymopoiesis led to increased absolute numbers of viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell. Our work demonstrated that thymic precursors can be therapeutically repopulated and its reconstitution leads to meaningful central and peripheral T-cell neogenesis, correcting immune dysfunction arising from age-associated thymic atrophy.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Immune insufficiency secondary to aging predisposes the host to detrimental infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Immune senescence manifested by thymic involution correlates to the progressive decline in T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and numerous defects in cellular immunity with severe clinical complications such as chronic inflammation, autoimmune diseases and low vaccination efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Normal thymopoiesis arises from marrow-derived CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> double-negative (DN) T-cell progenitors. Thereafter, DN develops into mature single-positive (SP) CD4 or CD8 T cells after expressing both CD4 and CD8 (double-positive, DP) transiently, leading to <italic>de novo</italic> T-cell production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Age-related progressive decline in thymic activity starts as early as the first year of postnatal life and is due to a combination of reduced thymic stroma and intrathymic proliferation of lymphoid precursors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Interleukin-7 (IL7) is a γ<sub>c</sub>-cytokine that has a key role in T-cell development and homeostasis by signaling through its cognate receptor complex IL7 receptor (IL7R)α/γ<sub>c</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Though the correlation between age-related hypotonic thymic activity and IL7 availability in the stromal niche is not clearly defined as IL7 is readily detectable in aged thymi,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> the use of exogenous IL7 for therapeutic lymphogenesis has been attempted. However, peripheral T-cell compartmentalization—preferential expansion of naïve and central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell—is a much more pronounced effect secondary to exogenous IL7 administration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> while thymic function remains largely unaltered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Moreover, intrathymic implantation of genetically engineered IL7-producing stromal cells fails to overcome age-associated atrophy or to maintain peripheral T-cell pool despite a transient increase in intrathymic proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Part of the reason for its modest therapeutic effect has to do with the homeostatic nature of IL7/IL7Rα interaction. The expression of IL7Rα is tightly regulated: it is upregulated on hematolymphoid cells destined to persist; it is downregulated on quiescent or exhausted cells, and it is internalized upon ligand binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Thus, the <italic>in vivo</italic> use of IL7 for regenerative immunotherapy is limited by the requirement to achieve supraphysiological concentrations to overcome immune checkpoints to its activating effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Knowing that IL7 signaling is fundamental to T-cell fate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> we attempt to overcome its limitation as a replacement therapy by utilizing an entirely synthetic cytokine signaling system. The notion therefore arises that creating a fusion cytokine borne of the physical linkage of two unrelated cytokines—a ‘fusokine'—will not only possess pharmaceutical properties ascribable to each parental domain, but may also acquire unheralded additive immune features. We have previously demonstrated the novel gain-of-function properties of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF)-based common γ<sub>c</sub> chain fusokines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> including: GIFT2, GIFT15,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> GIFT21,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> GIFT9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and GIFT4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> In this study, we show that engineered fusion GIFT7 delivers hyperagonistic signaling to IL7Rα/γ<sub>c</sub>; the unique biological consequence of such is the induction of SPCD8 and CD44<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup>DN1 expansion in thymocyte culture. Systemic administration of GIFT7 compared with IL7 in young immune competent mice leads to a transient increase in the number of DN1 (5.48±1.01 vs 2.74±1.07 × 10<sup>6</sup>, <italic>P</italic>=0.046) by day 7. Total thymic cellularity significantly increases in GIFT7-treated group by day 14 (237±51.3 vs 123±25.6 × 10<sup>6</sup>, <italic>P</italic>=0.026). The GIFT7-mediated regenerative effect is significantly more pronounced in 9- to 15-month-old retired breeder (RB) mice where thymic involution is evident: 111±21.8, 67.8±13.9, and 60.3±4.6 × 10<sup>6</sup> for seven doses of (5 μg kg<sup>−1</sup>) GIFT7, IL7 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment, respectively. Interestingly, the greatest fold increase is difference observed in the CD44<sup>int</sup> DN1 subset. Histologically, GIFT7-treated aged thymi demonstrate significant cortical hyperplasia. GIFT7-mediated thymopoiesis results in an enhanced viral-specific response, as evidenced by increased CD8<sup>+</sup> cellularity and IL2 secretion. Importantly, GIFT7-mediated augmentation in the anti-viral response was found to be persistent after effector immunity had waned in control groups. Thus, we demonstrated that the exploitation of GIFT7-derived hypersignalling to IL7Rα/γ<sub>c</sub> under conditions of thymic insufficiency led to competent repopulation of T lineage cells, highly amenable for the treatment of secondary lymphoid deficiency arising from viral, chemical and malignant insults.</p>

        <title>Biochemical characterization of GIFT7</title>
        <p>We engineered a <italic>G</italic>MCSF–<italic>I</italic>L7 <italic>F</italic>usion <italic>T</italic>ransgene (GIFT7) by cloning mGMCSF (murine GMCSF) cDNA in frame at the N-terminus of full-length murine IL7 cDNA. The resulting sequence of the fusion transgene was confirmed by sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Immunoblotting of the conditioned medium derived from GIFT7-transfected mammalian cell line demonstrated that the GIFT7 fusion protein is translated, secreted, and recognized by both α-GMCSF and α-IL7 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Computer-based homology structural model of the resultant GIFT7 protein is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). To predict the possible binding mode of GIFT7 with IL7Rα, we <italic>in silico</italic> aligned the IL7 portion of GIFT7 with the crystal structure of IL7 in complex with IL7Rα. The GMCSF portion of GIFT7 was not in steric clash with IL7Rα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). To investigate whether GIFT7 imparts distinct signaling property on receptor-expressing cells, the analysis of the activation status of common-gamma chain associated STAT5 and IL-7Rα associated STAT3 signal transduction molecules reveals an asymmetric signal transduction profile on GIFT7 treated, anti-CD3/28 bead-activated T cells. GIFT7 (1nM) induces STAT5 phosphorylation at levels comparable to GMCSF and IL7 but fails to induce a similar phosphorylation of STAT3 on activated T cells, suggesting a partial agonistic effect of GIFT7 on the IL7 receptor complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This effect was much more pronounced in activated T cells compared with naïve, primary T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). While STAT5 phosphorylation is critical for the activation of effector functions in T cells, STAT3 activation acts in a more regulatory manner to maintain homeostasis and to limit proinflammatory T-cell responses. Upon phosphorylation, these STAT molecules translocate to the nucleus where they alter their transcription patterns. The observation that GIFT7 drives an unopposed STAT5 response (that is, in the absence of STAT3 activation) led us to believe that GIFT7 treatment might impart a unique transcriptomic signature on lymphomyeloid cells compared to treatment with GMCSF and IL7.</p>
        <p>To further investigate the distinctive signaling property of GIFT7, we examined the transcriptional profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with GIFT7, IL7 alone, IL7 in combination with GMCSF, and media controls using RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). While all three treatments induced a common set of genes, we identified a set of 560 genes that were uniquely expressed in one or more treatment condition relative to the others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To organize these differentially expressed into expression patterns, we used unsupervised clustering on both genes and biological groups. Using the algorithm <italic>a priori</italic>, several patterns of gene expression became evident: (i) a cluster of genes induced by GIFT7 but not by the other treatments; (ii) several genes that were downregulated by only GIFT7 but not by other treatments; (iii) a class of genes that were induced by all three treatments but were remarkably higher in GIFT7-treated samples compared with IL7; or (iv) a small number of genes that were uniquely induced by IL7+GMCSF but not by IL7 alone or GIFT7. Overall, the numbers of genes that were uniquely regulated between IL7+GMCSF and IL7 alone were small compared with those uniquely regulated by GIFT7, which is reflected by the shorter distance of these treatments compared with GIFT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We focused our analysis on known genes in the T-cell differentiation and IL7 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Of note, the expression of the IL7R was observed to be downregulated in all three different treatment groups relative to media—providing an internal biological validation of the assay. Interestingly, IL7 itself had higher expression in GIFT7-treated samples compared with the IL7 and IL7+GMCSF groups, as was IL2, suggesting that GIFT7 signaling may exert its effect by induction of lymphocyte growth factors. Finally, we noted that GIFT7 induced a remarkably higher expression of IL17A, and to a lesser extent, IL17F, but not the non-canonical IL17 members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). IL22, whose expression is tightly linked to IL17,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> was also observed to be elevated in the GIFT7-treated groups relative to the IL7 treatments.</p>

        <title>GIFT7-treated DN and SPCD8 resist apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>We next sought to investigate the effect of GIFT7 on thymic T-cell precursors. Thymocytes were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old mice and cultured in the presence of GIFT7 (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) or control cytokines. Analysis of cultured thymocytes at day 5 demonstrated that GIFT7 promoted selective persistence of DN and SPCD8, while the ratio of thymic subsets was virtually unchanged with other cytokine treatments compared with media alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The expansive effect seemed to be saturated at 10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2a</xref>) as 50 and 100 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> concentrations appeared to induce similar level of changes. The dose-dependent effect of GIFT7, however, was clearly evident on T cells derived from PBMCs where increasing doses of GIFT7 leads to progressive CFSE dilution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2b</xref>). Similarly, DN and SPCD8 subsets increased in percentage over time with DN and SPCD8 representing 32 and 35%, respectively, in the GIFT7-treated thymocyte culture at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). GIFT7-treated DN and SPCD8 showed significantly less 7AAD inclusion compared with SPCD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). CFSE-pulsed sorted DN cells showed significant dilution after GIFT7 treatment in both TCRγδ<sup>−</sup> and TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> compartments, demonstrating the mitogenic effect of GIFT7 on DN subset in both αβ<sup>+</sup> and γδ<sup>+</sup> lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>).</p>
        <p>We pre-sorted DN, SPCD4, SPCD8 and DP thymocytes and subsequently stimulated them with GIFT7 for 9 days to test the hypothesis that GIFT7 modulates early T-cell differentiation. We demonstrated that GIFT7 alone did not significantly alter the expression of CD4 and CD8 on pre-sorted cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). In all, these data suggested that GIFT7 leads to the survival and expansion of DN early thymic progenitors and SPCD8 thymocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> without influencing their differentiation programming.</p>

        <title>GIFT7 leads to transient thymic hyperplasia in immune-competent young mice</title>
        <p>We next investigated the systemic effect of GIFT7 administration on thymic tissue in normal 6- to 8-week-old adult mice. In this experiment, we compared the effect of GIFT7 to IL7 on thymic cellularity analyzed at days 7, 14 or 35 post treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). On day 7, both IL7 and GIFT7-treated mice showed a significant increase in total thymic cellularity, which continued to rise in the GIFT7-treated group but started to decline in the IL7 group by day 14 (237±51.3 vs 123±25.6 × 10<sup>6</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Importantly, GIFT7 increased the percentage and the total number of DN1 cells by day 7 (5.48±1.01 vs 2.74±1.07 × 10<sup>6</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). The ratio of thymic subsets normalized between these two groups by day 1, but the increase in total thymocytes and DP with GIFT7 administration remained significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4D</xref>). On day 35 post injection, total thymic cellularity in both GIFT7- and IL7-treated groups declined to a level similar to that of before treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that GIFT7 was able to induce transient and reversible thymic hypertrophy. DN1 thymic progenitors appeared to be early GIFT7 responders, with concomitant increase in DP and total thymocytes at later stages.</p>

        <title>GIFT7 corrects age-related thymic atrophy and expands the CD44<sup>int</sup> DN subset</title>
        <p>Given the significant expansive effect of GIFT7 on young thymic tissue both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next investigated whether GIFT7 could correct age-related thymic involution. Here, we utilized RB mice (9–15 months old) as our sources of atrophic thymi. Mice were treated with 7 doses of IL7 or GIFT7 (5 μg kg<sup>−1</sup>) every other day. On day 28 post treatment, hematoxylin/eosin (H&amp;E) staining on thymic tissues of IL7-treated aged mice showed extensive adipocyte deposit (<bold>*</bold>), reduced cortical thymic tissue (cortex:medulla ratio 2:1) with intact cortical medullary thymic lining (<italic>interrupted arrow</italic>) whereas GIFT7-treated mice exhibited minimal adipocyte deposits (*), hypercellularity in the cortex (cortex:medulla ratio 2.67:1) and disrupted cortical-medullary lining with thymocytes infiltrating the medulla, indicating foci of proliferation (<italic>solid arrow</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>). In accordance with the histology data, GIFT7-treated mice had significantly higher number of total thymocytes (111±22, 68±14, 60±4.6 × 10<sup>6</sup>, for GIFT7-, IL7—treated and untreated—groups, respectively. F=0.0055 by one-way ANOVA). Comparison for each pair showed that thymic cellularity of GIFT7-treated mice is significantly greater than that of untreated (<italic>P</italic>=0.0027) or IL7-treated (<italic>P</italic>=0.0059) groups; whereas analysis of IL7—and untreated—groups yield no significant difference (<italic>P</italic>=0.49) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Cellular expansion was observed in DN, SPCD8 and SPCD4 (F=0.0005, 0.0004 and 0.0004, respectively). Specifically, GIFT7-DN exhibited the greatest fold difference compared with IL7 or untreated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). To assess whether GIFT7 mediated DN expansion enhanced <italic>de novo</italic> T-cell production, we measured the mRNA level of single-joint T-cell Receptor Excision Circle (TREC) per TCRα in total splenic DNA as a surrogate for thymic emigrants in the periphery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). Two out of three mice in the GIFT7-treated group showed a significant increase in peripheral sjTREC, suggesting a trend of recent thymic emigrants populating the periphery. To further analyze the DN subsets responsive to GIFT7 stimulation, we showed a significant increase in the percentage of CD44<sup>int</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> subset in the DN population (38.5, 13.6 and 10.4% for GIFT7, IL7 and untreated groups, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). In fact, there was a fourfold increase in the number of CD44<sup>int</sup> DN compared with thymocytes derived from untreated mice. Furthermore, expansion in the number of CD44<sup>hi</sup>DN1 and DN4 cells was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We also found significant downregulation of IL7Rα expression on CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> population in mice treated with GIFT7, suggesting receptor internalization upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). To better characterize the proliferative effect of GIFT7 and IL7 on DN subsets, we cultured purified DN cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and analyzed Ki67 after cytokine stimulation. Consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> observation, the most significant Ki67 induction was observed in GIFT7-treated CD44<sup>int</sup>DN1 subset, exhibiting 150% increase in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) over isotype staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5C</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that GIFT7 administration leads to CD44<sup>int</sup> DN expansion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <p>Latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation frequently correlates with immune compromised state. In post bone marrow transplant, viral clearance depends on functional T-cell reconstitution; in the elderly population, sufficient nascent T-cell output maintains viral inactivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> To investigate whether GIFT7-mediated thymopoiesis in aged mice would lead to an augmentation of acquired anti-viral immunity, we challenged IL7-, IL7+GMCSF-, GIFT7- or PBS-preconditioned mice with a non-lethal dose of murine CMV (mCMV) 7 days post cytokine treatment. Mice were killed at day 10 post viral infection. To measure the response of mCMV-specific T-cell immunity, we enumerated peptide MHC tetramer+ T cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6A</xref>). GIFT7 treatment significantly increased the number of mCMV-peptide MHC tetramer<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen (2.26±0.66 vs 1.2±0.51 × 10<sup>6</sup> for GIFT7 and untreated, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6B</xref>). To distinguish central (that is, thymopoiesis) vs peripheral contribution over the observed enhancement in viral CTL response, we repeated the experiment in thymectomized RB mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6C</xref>) and demonstrated that the number of mCMV-specific CD8 T cells in GIFT7-treated mice was not significantly different from other treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6D</xref>). To better understand the kinetics and the magnitude of GIFT7-mediated CTL response and to see how it compares with that of young 8-week-old mice, we repeated the experiment where cytokine-treated and mCMV-challenged RB mice were killed on 3, 7 or 21 days after viral inoculation to enumerate the development of anti-mCMV T-cell immunity in the spleen, as measured by peptide MHC tetramer staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). We included untreated young (8 weeks) animals in the analysis as a comparison to demonstrate the magnitude and kinetics of viral response secondary to cytokine treatment. On day 3, the frequency of tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells was &lt;0.1% in both young and aged animals of all treatment groups. On day 7, among the aged groups, GIFT7-treated animals had significantly higher frequency of mCMV peptide MHC tetramer+ CD8 T cells compared with PBS- or GMCSF+IL7- treated animals. On day 21 post viral challenge, we continued to detect elevated frequency of mCMV-specific CD8 T cells in the spleen derived from GIFT7-treated animals. The magnitude of GIFT7-mediated augmentation of mCMV-specific CD8 T-cell response on day 7 and 21 was comparable to the frequency detected in young animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Total live nucleated cells from the spleen were enumerated at different time points. Progressive increase in total splenocytes was detected from day 3 to day 21, but no significant difference was observed between different treatments or age groups at any given time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In terms of viral-specific cellularity, GIFT7-treated aged animals have significantly higher number of mCMV-specific CD8 T cells compared with PBS- or GMCSF+IL7-treated groups (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) on day 7 and all other groups including young animals (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) on day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Our data suggested that GIFT7-mediated thymopoiesis contributed to an increase in peripheral T cells poised to respond to a defined viral pathogen.</p>

        <title>Tetramer<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from GIFT7-treated group have higher frequency of IL2 and CD25 expression, respectively</title>
        <p>To further investigate the impact of GIFT7 on the restoration of aged T-cell immunity, we analyzed cell functionality per surface staining and cytokine secretion. We isolated splenocytes derived from animals on day 7 post mCMV infection and stimulated them <italic>in vitro</italic> with PMA/ionomycin. mCMV-specific CD8 T cells from GIFT7-treated group have enhanced propensity to produce IL2, but not IFNγ, compared with PBS or GMCSF+IL7 treated animals. GIFT7-treated aged animals have significantly higher frequency of IL2-producing mCMV tetramer+ CD8 T cells upon restimulation; however, young animals had the highest frequency of IL2<sup>+</sup>mCMV-tetramer<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> splenocytes. No significant difference was detected in the frequency of IFNγ-producing mCMV tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells between different age and treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we compared the expression levels of activation markers on the cell surface of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from GIFT7-treated group and others at day 7 post infection. Flow analysis revealed that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from GIFT7-treated group had significantly higher percentage of CD25 expression; whereas, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells among all the groups were almost devoid of CD25 expression. Moderately increased level of CD69 expression was detected in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from GMCSF+IL7- and GIFT7-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

      <p>Several regenerative approaches have been explored with the aim of restoring thymopoiesis in animal models of aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> None to date have been entirely satisfactory. Keratinocyte growth factor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> growth hormone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> or ghrelin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> reorganize thymic architecture by acting on thymic epithelial cells with only modest effect on lymphoid progenitors. γ<sub>c</sub> cytokine replacement therapy appears to have more impact on peripheral T-cell pool than <italic>de novo</italic> production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Here, we describe a novel thymic trophic approach by providing direct mitogenic signals to T-cell precursors via IL7Rα/γ<sub>c</sub> axis. We demonstrate that systemic administration of GIFT7 into young mice drives the expansion of thymic progenitors (DN1) resulting in a transient and reversible increase in total thymic cellularity by 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). This is not achievable via physiological signaling of IL7Rα/γ<sub>c</sub> as previous studies have demonstrated limited impact of IL7 supplementation on thymic ratio under immune competent conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> We further explore the utility of GIFT7 by harnessing its non-physiological signaling on RB mice with atrophic thymic tissue where the GIFT7-mediated hypertrophic thymopoiesis appears to be significantly more pronounced. The reduction of survival niche in the RB thymi responds to GIFT7 in a dramatic manner: hypertrophy of cortical tissue at the cortical-medullary junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), and a fourfold increase in CD44<sup>int</sup> DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). The increase in the RNA level of sjTREC per splenic TCRα<sup>+</sup> T cells in two out of three GIFT7-treated animals suggests a trend, though limited by the experimental numbers, of GIFT7-medated <italic>de novo</italic> T-cell regeneration detected at the periphery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). Sustained postnatal T-cell development depends on the continuous supply of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells as resident thymocytes are deemed to possess limited self-renewing capacity. This is evident in that mature T cells are rapidly replaced by BM sources after transient detection of thymic output in the periphery after thymic transplants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> However, Allman <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> shows that early thymic progenitors and BM common lymphoid progenitors are phenotypically diverse and postulates that thymic T lineage precursors represent a different route than BM common lymphoid progenitors. Matins <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> describes thymic-autonomous T-cell development with normal intrathymic differentiation and TCR diversification in the events of defective receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and γ<sub>c</sub> signaling localized at the BM compartment. Their studies show that by eliminating BM-derived competition for thymic survival niche, resident thymocytes exhibit full self-renewing capacities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Peaudecerf <italic>et al.</italic> describes a population of thymic precursors with the capacity to persist in the complete absence of functional bone marrow supply and defined them phenotypically as CD3<sup>−</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>low</sup>IL-7R<sup>low</sup> TN1-TN2 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Interestingly, both studies point to the importance of bone marrow-specific IL7-IL7Rα/γ<sub>c</sub> axis disruption in restoring intrathymic self-renewal. Thus, the continuous replacement of thymic progenitors by the bone marrow represents the competition for survival signals (that is, IL7) in the thymic niche instead of an intrinsic hierarchy of differentiation potential between bone marrow derived vs resident thymic T-lineage precursors. In line with this finding, our studies demonstrate that providing hypertonic STAT5 signaling <italic>in situ</italic> (that is, GIFT7) also contributes to T-cell neogenesis—especially under age-related immune insufficient state—via a route that is led by intrathymic proliferation and independent of BM modulation. However, the long-term effect of GIFT7-mediated thymopoiesis and reconstituting potential of the CD44<sup>int</sup> DN1 subsets remain to be assessed.</p>
      <p>The reduction in repertoire diversity represents an important cause of weakened host immunity during aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Indeed, thymic dysfunction can complicate numerous senescence-related immune pathologies; pharmacological regeneration of host immunity thus has a wide range of clinical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> We investigated the utility of GIFT7-mediated T-cell regeneration by demonstrating the repopulation of resident thymic precursors increases the absolute numbers of viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at day 7 post infection. Impressively, the level of GIFT7-mediated immune restoration in aged animals was comparable to that of young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The effect was found to be persistent at least after 21 days. In fact, we found the frequency and absolute numbers of viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly higher in the GIFT7-treated group, even compared with young animals, at day 21 post infection when the level of PBS- or GMCSF+IL7-treated groups was barely detectable. In essence, GIFT7 significantly increases the magnitude and the persistence of anti-viral CD8 response, but did not alter the kinetics at which adaptive immunity responds during the early phase of an acute infection. This can be explained at least in part by increased IL2-signaling activity detected in GIFT7-treated animals: we found that mCMV tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have higher level of IL2 production upon restimulation and the entire CD4<sup>+</sup> compartment had upregulated IL2Rα. This is consistent with the previous reports where IL2-derived paracrine signaling contributes to the <italic>in vivo</italic> persistence of memory T cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Supporting this hypothesis that GIFT7 may act to preserve the fate of memory T cells, we have found that GIFT7 acts preferentially to induce a STAT5 response in activated, memory-precursor T cells (IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>) compared with naïve T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). Akin to our observations, CD44<sup>int</sup> memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were shown to be the predominate pro-inflammatory cytokine-secreting cell population upon influenza NP<sub>366-374</sub> peptide re-stimulation of F5 TCR transgenic mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> Thus, we propose that GIFT7 treatment corrects age-associated immune deficiency during acute viral infection by (a) expanding the pool of thymic-derived <italic>de novo</italic> T cells available in responding to neo-antigens and (b) converting antigen-experienced effector T cells to a phenotype (IL2<sup>+</sup>tetramer<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> and IL2Rα<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>) more amendable for longer <italic>in vivo</italic> persistence.</p>
      <p>Activation strength is integral to the changes of nuclear gene expression profile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Augmented or truncated activity often leads to the induction of non-canonical signaling, a familiar narrative in the pathogenesis of malignancy. In the case of GIFT7, we demonstrate that treatment of activated T cells results in the activation of STAT5 alone, without a concomitant activation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Our observations are in line with previously published reports demonstrating that constitutive activation of STAT5 dramatically enhances T-cell survival via a Bcl-2-dependent mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> This observation is unsurprising given that Bcl-2 is positively regulated by STAT5, while STAT3 activation has been shown to inhibit Bcl-2 transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Furthermore, STAT5 activation has been shown to play a particularly important role in the expansion and preservation of memory T cells in the context of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection; a result we have recapitulated using GIFT7 to augment STAT5 activity in a mCMV model here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> GIFT7, while acting biochemically as a partial agonist, ultimately results in a hyperagonistic biological effect by driving an unopposed STAT5 signal. This is presumably due to atypical engagement and clustering of GMCSF and IL7 receptor complexes, an engineered feature of the GIFT fusions well described in our previously published work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Moreover, our genome-wide RNA sequence analysis of cytokine-treated T cells confirms that GIFT7 induces a differential program of gene expression than IL7. In essence, it shows that genes induced by IL7 and IL7+GM-CSF are overall more similar to each other than to the GIFT7 response. Interestingly, the gene profile of GIFT7-treated T cells also correlate with the upregulation of IL17-related genes, IL17A (2.8-fold change) and IL22 (8-fold change). In contrast to their earlier ascribed roles as short-lived effector cells, the memory characteristics of IL17-producing T cells have been unveiled and extensively studied as they have a propensity to persist <italic>in vivo</italic> while retaining significant cytolytic capacity as demonstrated in a number of tumor models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Thus, our data strongly suggest that GIFT7 imparts distinct signal transduction, gene transcription and cellular phenotype.</p>
      <p>Delayed reconstitution of the adaptive immunity post-HSCT significantly increases the risk of opportunistic fungal and viral infections for the recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> This is of grave concern particularly for the elderly population as the normalization of their T-cell compartment derives primarily from extrathymic expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> The consequence of such is a further delay in immune recovery without the regeneration of TCR repertoire diversity required for an efficient response against neo-antigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> As IL7 has been shown to accelerate immune recovery in both murine model of bone marrow transplant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> and patients of post-allo-HSCT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> it is worthwhile to test the hypothesis of using GIFT7 as an immune regenerative agent in the setting of allo-HSCT of the elderly. Of note, exogenous IL7 does not seem to promote GvHD in a conclusive manner, presumably because IL7-responsive subsets in the setting of lymphopenic recovery seem to reside in the effector memory/non-alloreactive compartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> We therefore propose the use of GIFT7 or GIFT7-enhanced T-cell precursors for the treatment of human thymic hypoimmune ailments with unmet clinical needs.</p>

Isolated PBMC was cultured in RPMI complete media supplemented with α-CD3/CD28-coated beads (Invitrogen). After 48 h, dynabeads were washed off by incubating cell suspension in EasySep Magnet (STEMCELL) for 5 min. PBMC culture was replenished with fresh RPMI complete media supplemented with the human ortholog of murine GIFT7 (20 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) or equimolar concentration of hIL7 or hIL7+hGMCSF for 3 days. Cells were obtained and live CD3+ cells were sorted by flow cytometry. The RNA from sorted cells was extracted using QIAGEN RNeasy kits according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and RNA with RIN scores &gt;8.0 were using for RNA-seq. RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq producing 2 × 100 paired end reads. Reads were assessed with FastQC and had a Q20 depth of 9.95–14.7 Million. Reads were mapped to the hg19 assembly using Tophat with mapping percentages greater than 50%. Sample reads were assembled into transcript models using Cufflinks, which were then merged and run through Cuffdiff to produce per sample FPKM expression levels and estimate differential expression between the three treatments compared with media. Treatment responses were estimated as the ratio between the expression level for a treatment condition to the expression level for the media sample. To estimate differential treatment response, we did a pairwise comparison for each transcript as the difference in treatment responses. From this we calculated a maximum difference metric as the differential treatment response with the largest absolute value: genes were ranked by the maximum difference (MaxDiff) between the three treatment responses (hIL7, hGMCSF+IL7 and hGIFT7) and selected the 560 genes where MaxDiff was at least 1 in a log2 scale, which represents at least a twofold differential response. To organize the MaxDiff genes for effective visualization and to segregate into groups based on expression patterns, we performed hierarchical clustering, with Euclidean distance and Pearson dissimilary metrics for genes and samples, respectively.

        <p>For intracellular Ki67 staining, cultured thymocytes were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were then incubated in 0.5% Tween-20/1% PFA buffer at room temperature for 30 min. All intracellular cytokine staining was performed with Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (BD Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's instruction. All fluorescence-activated cell sorter antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA, USA).</p>

        <title>GIFT7 administration and mCMV infection</title>
        <p>In all, 5 μg kg<sup>−1</sup> of GIFT7 was administered i.p. into aged mice (C57Bl/6 RB) every other day for a total of seven injections. Recombinant mGMCSF and mIL7 (R&amp;D System) were used as cytokine controls. Mice were infected i.p. with 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> (or 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> for athymic animals) plaque-forming unit salivary gland passed Smith strain MCMV (a gift from Dr Mohammad S Hossain, Emory University, USA) 7 days after the last GIFT7 (or control cytokine) injection. Spleens were obtained from infected 3, 7 or 21 days post viral inoculation for total and mCMV-specific T-cell analysis.</p>

        <title>TREC analysis</title>
        <p>Splenic DNA was isolated using DNA purification kit (Qiagen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in triplicates on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system thermal cycler (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 15 μl volume, containing 100 ng of sample DNA, 500nM of forward and reverse primers, SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). The forward and reverse TREC primers were 5′-CCAAGCTGACGGCAGGTTT-3′ and 3′-AGCATGGCAAGCAGCACC-5′, respectively; the forward and reverse primers for TCRα were 5′-TGACTCCCAAATCAATGTG-3′ and 5′-GCAGGTGAAGCTTGTCTG-3′, respectively. The relative expression of sjTREC over TCRα was expressed as 2<sup>−ΔCT</sup> with ΔCT being defined as (CT of sjTREC−CT of TCRα). Fold difference is expressed as the relative mRNA expression normalized against the average relative expression of sjTREC over TCRα in the untreated group.</p>

Polyclonal goat anti-mouse GMCSF and anti-IL7 antibodies or polyclonal goat anti-human GMCSF and anti-IL7 antibodies serve to probe the blot, indicating fusion protein secretion. (<bold>c</bold>) The homology structural model of mouse GIFT7. The GMCSF and IL7 portions are in green and pink ribbons, respectively. The link region is in black; (<bold>d</bold>) western blotting for phospho-specific and total STAT3 and STAT5 proteins from cell lysates of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> anti-CD3/28 bead-activated T cells previously stimulated with 1 n<sc>M</sc> GIFT-7 or cytokine controls for 15 min. (<bold>e</bold>) GIFT7 induces differential transcriptional program over IL7. Illumina deep sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to identify gene expression of PBMCs treated with hGIFT7, hIL7 alone, or hIL7+hGMCSF and media controls. 560 genes were identified as maximally different between treatment groups, visualized using hierarchical clustering. (<bold>f</bold>) RNA-seq profiles of genes expression pattern as fold-change difference in the IL7 and IL17 pathway (<italic>n</italic>=1).</p>
