      <title>Objective</title>
      <p>This presentation aims to discuss the need and share the results from an
international, multi-disciplinary mission to assess public health surveillance (PHS)
in Sudan and develop a plan of action (PoA) to strengthen PHS through integration.
We will present the findings of the mission and the resulting PoA developed for
Public Health Surveillance Strengthening (PHSS) designed to rapidly detect, report
and respond to infectious diseases and establish sustainable, integrated One Health
concepts.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="intro">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) is a strategy conceived and
adopted by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa in 1998. The
goal of IDSR is to support PHSS in Africa and enhance efficiency and communication
across all levels of the national public health system. IDSR emphasizes the
commitment of the revised International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)] to
strengthen and maintain core capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to
public health events of international concern.</p>
      <p>In February 2014, the Sudan Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), requested an
assessment of PHS with attention to PHSS integration opportunities and enhancing
their ability to meet IHR (2005) requirements. A WHO Regional Office for the Eastern
Mediterranean (WHO/EMRO) team of consultants performed this mission in collaboration
with the FMoH.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="methods">
      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>The mission drew observations and conclusions and framed recommendations, derived
from document reviews, semi-structured interviews with key informants, discussions
with heads of disease- specific programs and through observations on how PHS data
were collected and reported from the peripheral levels to higher levels, as seen
during the field visits. The findings of this technical mission and the
recommendations were formulated into a country report and PoA.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="results">
      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The mission found that PHS in Sudan consisted of multiple, siloed, vertical disease
PHS systems, each using separate data collection and reporting paper-based forms.
This resulted in duplication of data collection and inconsistencies in reported data
from various sources. It also creates a burden on staff. A PoA to implement and
sustain PHSS through integration in Sudan was developed and recommended to the Sudan
FMoH. The PoA advocated a strategic approach of PHSS, which incorporated IHR (2005)
and One Health concepts.</p>
      <p>This PoA included technical, training, and management support services required to
establish PHSS, e-Surveillance, and a Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) in
Sudan. The main activities of this approach included:</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Empowering PHSS will equip a motivated health staff with a strategy to streamline PHS
functions; coordinate an “all-hazards” monitoring and alert approach;
and provide national consistency for detection, analyses, and reporting. If
implemented, the recommended PoA supports a long-term goal to shift – in a
phased manner – from the present fragmented, disease-specific, PHS focus, to
an integrated one with full implementation capacity at the community, local, state,
and national levels.</p>
