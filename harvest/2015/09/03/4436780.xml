      <abstract>
        <p>Calponin-related proteins are widely distributed among eukaryotes and involved in signaling and cytoskeletal regulation. Calponin-like (CLIK) repeat is an actin-binding motif found in the C-termini of vertebrate calponins. Although CLIK repeats stabilize actin filaments, other functions of these actin-binding motifs are unknown. The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans unc-87</italic> gene encodes actin-binding proteins with seven CLIK repeats. UNC-87 stabilizes actin filaments and is essential for maintenance of sarcomeric actin filaments in striated muscle. Here we show that two UNC-87 isoforms, UNC-87A and UNC-87B, are expressed in muscle and nonmuscle cells in a tissue-specific manner by two independent promoters and exhibit quantitatively different effects on both actin and myosin. Both UNC-87A and UNC-87B have seven CLIK repeats, but UNC-87A has an extra N-terminal extension of ∼190 amino acids. Both UNC-87 isoforms bind to actin filaments and myosin to induce ATP-resistant actomyosin bundles and inhibit actomyosin motility. UNC-87A with an N-terminal extension binds to actin and myosin more strongly than UNC-87B. UNC-87B is associated with actin filaments in nonstriated muscle in the somatic gonad, and an <italic>unc-87</italic> mutation causes its excessive contraction, which is dependent on myosin. These results strongly suggest that proteins with CLIK repeats function as a negative regulator of actomyosin contractility.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Muscle contractile apparatuses are highly organized, with properly arranged actin and myosin filaments, together with regulatory components for contractility (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). To produce efficient contractile forces, bipolar myosin filaments and actin filaments with proper orientations need to be assembled into sarcomeric patterns. Additional structural and regulatory proteins support integrity and dynamics of the contractile structures and modulate the actin–myosin interaction (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Squire, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ono, 2010</xref>). Such mechanisms are important not only in muscle but also in nonmuscle cells when transient or persistent contractile apparatuses are required to support cell migration, cell division, and morphogenesis (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</xref>). However, how actomyosin-based contractile structures are assembled and regulated in vivo is not fully understood.</p><p>Calponin is a cytoskeletal protein that is expressed in both muscle and nonmuscle cells and has biochemical activities to stabilize actin filaments and regulate actomyosin contractility (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Rozenblum and Gimona, 2008</xref>). Of note, calponin has been characterized as a major component of smooth muscle thin filaments in vertebrates (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). In vitro, calponin binds to actin filaments and myosin and inhibits actomyosin ATPase in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin–regulated manner (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Winder and Walsh, 1990</xref>). Consistently, in skinned smooth muscle cells, calponin is required for maintaining a relaxed state by inhibiting contractility caused by unphosphorylated myosin (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Malmqvist <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). However, in vivo, calponin-knockout mice show only mild alterations in smooth muscle contractility (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Matthew <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). This may be due to the presence of functionally overlapping proteins such as caldesmon (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hodgkinson, 2000</xref>) and/or structurally related proteins such as SM22/transgelin (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pearlstone <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Vertebrate calponins have one calponin-homology (CH) domain in the N-terminus and three calponin-like (CLIK) repeats (or motifs) in the C-terminus (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Rozenblum and Gimona, 2008</xref>). Although CH domains are found in a number of signaling or cytoskeletal proteins and function as an actin-binding domain in many cases, the CH domain of calponin does not bind to actin (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gimona and Mital, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Galkin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Instead, the CLIK repeats in the C-terminus of calponins are essential for binding to actin filaments (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gimona and Mital, 1998</xref>). The number of CLIK repeats in naturally occurring proteins correlates with the strength of actin-binding. SM22/transgelin, which has only one CLIK repeat, binds to actin at lower affinity than calponin, which has three CLIK repeats (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Shapland <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). UNC-87 in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a unique protein with seven CLIK repeats and no CH domain (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994a</xref>), which binds to actin filaments with high affinity (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kranewitter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Of importance, proteins with multiple CLIK repeats stabilize actin filaments and prevent depolymerization in vitro (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kake <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Studies in mammalian cells have shown a correlation between the number of CLIK repeats and the actin-stabilizing function (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gimona <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and as a consequence to inhibit cell migration and cytokinesis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lener <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The biochemical analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-87 protein unambiguously demonstrated the function of the CLIK repeat as an actin-binding motif (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kranewitter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans unc-87</italic> gene is essential for proper sarcomeric actin organization in larval and adult striated muscle but not for initial sarcomere assembly in embryos (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994a</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). UNC-87 competes with actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin for binding to actin filaments and protects actin filaments from severing by ADF/cofilin (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Although the actin-stabilizing role of UNC-87 is similar to that of tropomyosin (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Ono and Ono, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Yu and Ono, 2006</xref>), UNC-87 and tropomyosin apparently have opposite roles in sarcomere organization in striated muscle (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), suggesting that UNC-87 has an additional, uncharacterized function other than actin-filament stabilization. Furthermore, the initial analysis of the <italic>unc-87</italic> gene identified two gene products with different N-terminal sequences, but functional differences between the two isoforms are unknown. In this study, we report that the two UNC-87 isoforms are expressed in different tissues in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and bind to both actin and myosin. This results in inhibition of actomyosin motility and formation of ATP-resistant actomyosin bundles. Genetic analysis shows that UNC-87B is a negative regulator of myosin-dependent contractility of smooth muscle–like cells in the somatic gonad. These results reveal a novel function of UNC-87 isoforms as regulators of actomyosin contractility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Two alternative promoters drive expression of two UNC-87 isoforms in a tissue-specific manner</title><p>The original report of the molecular characterization of the <italic>unc-87</italic> gene demonstrated that two isoforms are expressed from the <italic>unc-87</italic> gene by an alternative choice of the first two exons (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994a</xref>; Supplemental Figure S1, A–C). According to WormBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link>), the large and small isoforms have been designated UNC-87A (565 amino acids) and UNC-87B (374 amino acids), respectively. To maintain consistency, the downstream first exon used in UNC-87A is designated exon 1A, and the upstream exon used in UNC-87B is designated exon 1B (Supplemental Figure S1A). To determine the mechanism of isoform-specific expression, we examined whether exon 1A or 1B is selectively expressed by independent promoters. We hypothesized that the flanking upstream sequence of each first exon contains promoter activity. To test this, we fused 2-kb upstream sequences from exons 1A and 1B with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter (Supplemental Figure S1, D and E) and examined their promoter activity in vivo.</p><p>The reporter analysis showed that expression of exons 1A and 1B was driven by separate promoters in a tissue-specific manner. The 2-kb upstream sequence from exon 1A, which is entirely downstream of exon 1B (Supplemental Figure S1D; <italic>Punc-87A::GFP</italic>), promoted expression of GFP in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, A–D</xref>), anal depressor muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, A, E, and F</xref>), uterine muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, A, G, and H</xref>), vulva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, G and H</xref>), and unidentified neurons in the head and the ventral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, A, C, and D</xref>). By contrast, the 2-kb upstream sequence from exon 1B (Supplemental Figure S1E; <italic>Punc-87B::GFP</italic>) promoted expression of GFP in the body wall muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, I–L</xref>), spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, I, J, M, and N</xref>), and vulva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, I–L</xref>). Because the hermaphroditic gonads were obscured by strong GFP signals in the body wall muscle, expression of GFP was further analyzed in dissected gonads by immunofluorescence staining for GFP and MYO-3, a myosin heavy chain expressed in the myoepithelial sheath (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ardizzi and Epstein, 1987</xref>). The results showed predominant expression of GFP from the <italic>unc-87B</italic> promoter both in the myoepithelial sheath (MYO-3 positive) and the spermatheca (MYO-3 negative; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, U–W</xref>) but not from the <italic>unc-87A</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, R–T</xref>) or in the gonad with no transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, O–Q</xref>). These results suggest that separate promoters for <italic>unc-87A</italic> and <italic>unc-87B</italic> are tissue specific in a mutually exclusive manner except for the vulva and control expression of the two UNC-87 isoforms.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Promoter analysis of <italic>unc-87A</italic> and <italic>unc-87B</italic>.

Images of whole worms with their heads on the left (A, B, I, and J) and magnified views of representative tissues (C–H, K–N) are shown.

We determined mutation sites in two <italic>unc-87</italic> alleles: <italic>unc-87(e1216)</italic> shows mild defects in body wall muscle, and <italic>unc-87(e1459)</italic> shows very severe defects (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994a</xref>). We sequenced the genomic sequences and found that <italic>unc-87(e1216)</italic> had a point mutation (G to A) at the splice donor site in exon 2 (Supplemental Figure S1F) and <italic>unc-87(e1459)</italic> had two point mutations in exon 2, a missense mutation (A207V in UNC-87A or A16V in UNC-87B) and a nonsense mutation (W225stop in UNC-87A or W34stop in UNC-87B; Supplemental Figure S1F). Therefore these mutations are located in common exons for UNC-87A and UNC-87B and should affect both isoforms. <italic>unc-87(e1216)</italic> expresses reduced levels of UNC-87 proteins (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994a</xref>), suggesting that the mutation reduces efficiency of splicing but does not completely inhibit protein expression, thereby acting as a weak loss-of-function allele. By contrast, <italic>unc-87(e1459)</italic> does not express detectable UNC-87 proteins (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994a</xref>), indicating that this is a null or a strong loss-of-function mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>UNC-87A, a longer isoform, exhibits stronger actin-bundling activity than UNC-87B</title><p>Previous biochemical studies on UNC-87 were done using UNC-87B, a shorter isoform (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kranewitter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and characterization of UNC-87A has not been reported. To determine whether the two UNC-87 isoforms have any different biochemical properties, we produced and purified recombinant UNC-87A protein and compared it biochemically with UNC-87B.</p><p>UNC-87B has been shown to bind to F-actin and bundle the filaments (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kranewitter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Similarly, UNC-87A bound to F-actin, as determined by cosedimentation assays using ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), and bundled actin filaments, as determined by sedimentation assays using low-speed centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the cosedimentation assays using ultracentrifugation, UNC-87A bound to F-actin so strongly that nearly all UNC-87A cosedimented with F-actin at low UNC-87A concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; 1.1 μM UNC-87A to 10 μM actin), which makes it difficult to estimate its affinity for F-actin. In the sedimentation assays using low-speed centrifugation, in which only bundled actin filaments precipitate, UNC-87A induced bundle formation of actin filaments (10 μM actin) at &gt;1.1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, black circles). By comparing these data with the published data on UNC-87B (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), we see that UNC-87A showed much stronger actin-bundling activity than UNC-87B, in particular, at a low concentration range (&lt;2.5 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>UNC-87 isoforms bundle actin filaments.

We tested this by observing morphology of fluorescently labeled actin filaments by microscopy in the presence or absence of UNC-87 proteins and/or Ce-myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In the absence of Ce-myosin or UNC-87, only single actin filaments were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), and ATP did not alter the morphology of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Ce-myosin induced formation of short, needle-like bundles of actin filaments in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), but these bundles were nearly completely disassembled in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). These are consistent with conserved properties of conventional myosin: actin-filament bundling by two-headed myosin molecules and ATP-dependent dissociation of myosin heads from actin filaments. By contrast, both UNC-87A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) and UNC-87B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>) induced formation of much larger and longer actin bundles than Ce-myosin–induced bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), and UNC-87-induced actin bundles were resistant to ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, F and J</xref>). Of interest, when both Ce-myosin and UNC-87 proteins were simultaneously present, more-robust formation of actin bundles was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, G and K</xref>). Actin bundles were much larger in the presence of both Ce-myosin and UNC-87 than in the presence of Ce-myosin or UNC-87 alone. In addition, a number of unbundled single actin filaments remained in the presence of UNC-87A or UNC-87B alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, E and I</xref>), but unbundled filaments were almost undetectable in the presence of both Ce-myosin and UNC-87A or UNC-87B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, G and K</xref>), suggesting that most of the actin filaments were bundled by the synergistic effects of Ce-myosin and UNC-87A or UNC-87B. We also found that UNC-87 isoforms induced different forms of actin bundles in the presence of Ce-myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, G and K</xref>).

The inhibitory role of UNC-87 isoforms for actomyosin contractility was further demonstrated in vivo: <italic>unc-87</italic> mutants showed excessive contraction of the myoepithelial sheath, a smooth muscle–like tissue in the somatic gonad. In addition to the previously reported function of UNC-87B to stabilize actin filaments (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kranewitter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), the present study revealed another function of UNC-87 to regulate actomyosin contractility. In vertebrate smooth muscle, similar dual functions have been demonstrated in vitro for calponin (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Winder <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), caldesmon (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hemric and Chalovich, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Velaz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>), and fesselin/synaptopodin-2 (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Schroeter and Chalovich, 2005</xref>), but their in vivo functions are not clearly understood. UNC-87A and UNC-87B are the only known actin-bundling proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that also inhibit actomyosin contractility. Our biochemical and genetic studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggest that UNC-87 isoforms are functional homologues of these vertebrate proteins and regulate actin filament stability and actomyosin contractility in vivo.</p><p>The two UNC-87 isoforms with different N-terminal sequences are expressed in different tissues. Our biochemical analysis shows that UNC-87A, with a longer N-terminus, has more robust actin-bundling and stronger myosin-binding activities than UNC-87B, with a shorter N-terminus, suggesting that these quantitative differences in their activities are important for their tissue-specific functions. UNC-87B is predominantly expressed in the body wall muscle and the somatic gonad, where it regulates actin organization (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994a</xref>), actin filament stability (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and contractility (this study). Therefore the relatively weak activity of UNC-87B might be optimal for actin regulation in these striated and nonstriated muscles. By contrast, the in vivo function of UNC-87A is unknown because a specific mutation for <italic>unc-87A</italic> is not available. The mutations in <italic>unc-87(e1216)</italic> and <italic>unc-87(e1459)</italic> are located in exon 2, which is common to both UNC-87 isoforms (Supplemental Figure S1F). Therefore UNC-87A should also be ablated in these mutants. However, we were not able to detect a phenotype in tissues in which expression of UNC-87A was detected (unpublished data). This might be due to a weak phenotype or a phenotype other than actin organization and contractility, which we might have overlooked. Another possibility is that a functionally overlapping actin-binding protein compensates for the function of UNC-87A.</p><p>UNC-87A and UNC-87B commonly have seven CLIK repeats but are different in their N-terminal sequences. UNC-87A (565 amino acids) has an extra ∼190 amino acids with no homology to known functional protein sequences, which is absent in UNC-87B (374 amino acids; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994a</xref>). Although this N-terminal sequence of UNC-87A is most likely responsible for the quantitative differences in the activities of the UNC-87 isoforms, a role of this unique region is unknown. If this region binds to F-actin or myosin, it may cooperate with the C-terminal CLIK repeats to enhance binding of UNC-87A to F-actin or myosin. Alternatively, the N-terminal sequence may allosterically enhance an actin- or myosin-binding function of the C-terminus. Previous functional studies on recombinant proteins containing different numbers of CLIK repeats showed that an increase in the number of CLIK repeats is correlated with an increase in actin-stabilizing functions in vitro (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kranewitter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and in cultured cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gimona <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lener <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). CLIK repeats appear to be intrinsically unstructured in solution (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Rozenblum and Gimona, 2008</xref>), and the unique sequence of the UNC-87A may have a function similar to CLIK repeats even in the absence of sequence similarity.</p><p>Myosin binding and inhibition of actomyosin ATPase are novel functions of UNC-87 isoforms. Our biochemical experiments show that both UNC-87 isoforms can mediate formation of ATP-resistant actomyosin bundles. Therefore UNC-87 proteins can also function not only as a regulator of actomyosin contractility, but also as a stabilizer of actomyosin structural integrity. These activities of UNC-87 isoforms are indeed consistent with the previously reported <italic>unc-87</italic> mutant phenotypes. In body wall muscle, sarcomeric actin filaments are disorganized in <italic>unc-87</italic> mutants, but this phenotype can be suppressed by a mutation in the <italic>unc-54</italic> myosin heavy chain (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Goetinck and Waterston, 1994b</xref>), suggesting that a loss of the inhibitory function of UNC-87B for actomyosin contractility can be compensated by reduction in the contractile function of myosin itself. Alternatively, UNC-87B may normally stabilize sarcomeres against mechanical stress by actin–myosin cross-linking, and reduced contractility due to the myosin mutation can suppress mechanical damage on sarcomeres in <italic>unc-87</italic> mutants.</p><p>The myoepithelial sheath of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> somatic gonad is nonstriated muscle and essential for oocyte maturation and ovulation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, the mechanism of regulation of myoepithelial sheath contractility is poorly understood. Unlike vertebrate smooth muscle, the troponin–tropomyosin system is required for contractility of myoepithelial sheath (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Myers <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Ono and Ono, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Obinata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). When the two troponin I isoforms, TNI-1 and UNC-27, are depleted, the myoepithelial sheath becomes excessively contracted (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Obinata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), which is similar to the phenotype of <italic>unc-87</italic> mutants. Thus, in addition to troponin I, which is well established as an inhibitor of actomyosin interaction (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Squire and Morris, 1998</xref>), UNC-87B is also important for contractile regulation in the myoepithelial sheath. However, the functional difference between troponin and UNC-87B is unknown. The troponin complex is regulated by calcium (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ebashi, 1984</xref>), but UNC-87B is not likely to be regulated by calcium or calcium/calmodulin because of a lack of recognizable sequence for binding to these ligands. Therefore troponin and UNC-87B may function as calcium-dependent and -independent regulators, respectively.</p><p>UNC-87B was associated with actin filaments in the myoepithelial sheath but did not appear to have an essential role in assembly or maintenance of the nonstriated actin networks. Previously we showed that ADF/cofilin (UNC-60A; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ono <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and two actin-interacting protein 1 isoforms (UNC-78 and AIPL-1; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Ono and Ono, 2014</xref>) are essential for assembly of the nonstriated actin networks in the myoepithelial sheath. These proteins enhance actin filament dynamics by promoting actin filament disassembly (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Ono and Benian, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ono <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Mohri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Because UNC-87B strongly inhibits actin filament severing by ADF/cofilin in vitro, it should be interesting to determine whether UNC-87B and/or a functionally similar protein antagonizes ADF/cofilin and actin-interacting protein 1 during assembly and maintenance of nonstriated actin networks.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-87 isoforms are actin-associated inhibitors of actomyosin contractility in vitro and in vivo. In addition to the previously characterized role of UNC-87B as a stabilizer of actin filaments, these functions are important for contractility of striated and nonstriated muscles. These functions have been proposed for vertebrate proteins, including calponin, caldesmon, and fesselin/synaptopodin-2, mostly from biochemical studies, but have not been clearly demonstrated in vivo. This could be partly due to functional redundancy among functionally similar proteins. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome does not have caldesmon or fesselin/synaptopodin-2, and its relatively simple system allowed us to determine the biological significance of the CLIK-repeat protein. Furthermore, we detected tissue-specific expression of UNC-87 isoforms in both muscle and nonmuscle cells, suggesting that UNC-87A or UNC-87B is involved in actin-dependent events in a variety of cell types. Similarly, calponins and calponin-like proteins in other organisms should also function in a similar manner to UNC-87 isoforms using CLIK repeats as actin-binding motifs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Nematode strains</title><p>The following strains were obtained from the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (Minneapolis, MN) and used in this study: wild-type strain N2, CB1216 <italic>unc-87(e1216)</italic>, CB1459 <italic>unc-87(e1459)</italic>, RW1524 <italic>unc-87(e1459) unc-54(s95)</italic>, and RW5008 <italic>unc-54(s95)</italic>.
