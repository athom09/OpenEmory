        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging neuroinvasive flavivirus that now causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The innate and adaptive immune responses to WNV infection have been well studied in C57BL/6J inbred mice, but this model lacks the variations in susceptibility, immunity, and outcome to WNV infection that are observed in humans, thus limiting its usefulness to understand the mechanisms of WNV infection and immunity dynamics. To build a model of WNV infection that captures human infection outcomes, we have used the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse model. We show that this model, which recapitulates the genetic diversity of the human population, demonstrates diversity in susceptibility and outcomes of WNV infection observed in humans. Using multiple F1 crosses of CC mice, we identified a wide range of susceptibilities to infection, as demonstrated through differences in survival, clinical disease score, viral titer, and innate and adaptive immune responses in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Additionally, we examined the <italic>Oas1b</italic> alleles in the CC mice and confirmed the previous finding that <italic>Oas1b</italic> plays a role in susceptibility to WNV; however, even within a given <italic>Oas1b</italic> allele status, we identified a wide range of strain-specific WNV-associated phenotypes. These results confirmed that the CC model is effective for identifying a repertoire of host genes involved in WNV resistance and susceptibility. The CC effectively models a wide range of WNV clinical, virologic, and immune phenotypes, thus overcoming the limitations of the traditional C57BL/6J model, allowing genetic and mechanistic studies of WNV infection and immunity in differently susceptible populations.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging flavivirus. It is an enveloped virus that encodes a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) positive-sense genome (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Since its introduction to North America in 1999, the virus has spread throughout the United States and into Canada, Mexico, and Latin America (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), to now cause significant morbidity and mortality in the Western hemisphere and represent a global public health problem. WNV is neuroinvasive and can cause disease ranging from self-limiting febrile illness to disease of the central nervous system (CNS), including meningitis and encephalitis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Neuroinvasive infection and CNS disease can be particularly deadly and leave survivors with long-term physical and cognitive disabilities (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Approximately 20% of infected individuals experience a limited febrile illness, with 1% developing a more severe neuroinvasive disease characterized by encephalitis, meningitis, and acute flaccid paralysis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Additionally, a more chronic poliomyelitis-like syndrome can occur, in which patients experience neurologic weakness and/or tremor 1Â year after their acute illness (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Several host genetic factors and immune correlates that influence susceptibility or severity of infection have been identified through blood donor screening programs or retrospective studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">TableÂ 1</xref>). Specifically, a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>CCR5</italic> corresponded to an increased severity in WNV infection, though it was not associated with increased susceptibility (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A genomics study with more than 1,500 symptomatic patients showed that severe neuroinvasive disease was associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding a sodium channel, <italic>SCN1a</italic>, and a cell replication factor, <italic>RFC1</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). SNPs in key regulators of immune function may be associated with increased risk of infection and progression to severe neurological disease. Beyond these studies, limited knowledge is available regarding the immune response to WNV in humans, due to the high prevalence of subclinical infection that precludes identification of WNV-infected individuals and subsequent clinical and immune response evaluations. Thus, most knowledge of anti-WNV immunity comes from the study of WNV infection using inbred mouse models of infection, generally using wild-type (WT) and transgenic gene knockout C57BL/6J mice (B6 mice). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1</xref>, we highlight the immunologic and clinical parameters that can be readily evaluated in human patients with WNV infection compared to WNV-infected B6 mice. Specifically, the B6 model has been invaluable, as it allows for measurement of viral load in tissues, including both the peripheral nervous system and CNS, as well as inflammatory responses. While these properties cannot be measured in human patients, symptoms such as long-term neurological weakness (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">â</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and gastrointestinal (GI) involvement (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) are found in human patients but are not observed to occur in the B6 infection model. Currently, immune responses in the B6 model that may also be measured in human studies are limited to peripheral blood T cell responses (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), serum antibody responses (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and overt signs of clinical disease (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">TableÂ 1</xref> further describes this diversity of outcomes in human infection.</p>

      <p>Compared to this diverse breadth of clinical outcomes and immune responses observed in the human population, the B6 mouse model of WNV infection is much less variable. Specifically, when infected subcutaneously in the footpad with the contemporary emerging and neuroinvasive strain of WNV, approximately 30% of infected mice succumb to infection within 10 to 12Â days postinfection, depending on the inoculum dose (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">â</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). While this outcome captures the processes of neuroinvasive disease of the CNS observed in human West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND), B6 mice generally display extremely similar immunophenotypes with a repeatable fraction of animals transitioning to symptomatic infection. Upon subcutaneous infection, WNV replicates locally in myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which initiate cell-intrinsic innate immune responses that can restrict infection. These cells also migrate to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and subsequently initiate adaptive immune responses. Infected cells first sense the presence of WNV through the actions of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I, and MDA5 expressed within the cell cytoplasm and subsequently through endosomal Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Virus sensing drives RLR signaling to downstream activation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-ÎºB for induction of direct gene targets. These genes encode antiviral proteins that confer antiviral actions to restrict WNV replication and cytokines and chemokines that serve to modulate the innate and adaptive immune response to infection. Type I IFN is a major component of this response which facilitates an antiviral state through autocrine and paracrine signaling actions that induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that have antiviral and immunomodulatory activities to drive systemic antiviral actions. Studies with the B6 model have shown that innate and adaptive immune responses orchestrate protection and control of WNV infection and disease (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). RLR-mediated innate immunity and IFN actions are essential for restricting WNV replication and neuroinvasion to the CNS (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">â</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), while humoral immunity is involved in peripheral viral clearance. Moreover, T cells are critical for viral clearance in the CNS. Specifically, the induction of virus-specific IgM early postinfection with WNV limits viremia and spread to the CNS, thereby helping to protect against lethal infection (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A role for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in immunity to WNV infection was demonstrated via adoptive transfer of WNV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which led to prolonged survival after WNV infection in recipient mice. Importantly, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were found to infiltrate the infected brains, suggesting that these T cells could be involved in recovery from encephalitis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> dynamics of these innate and adaptive immune responses that are associated with differential outcomes of WNV infection in the human population have not been effectively modeled and therefore remain poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Given the breadth in symptoms and disease severity seen in human WNV infection that are not effectively captured in the B6 model, we turned to the newly developed Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse to better model WNV infection and understand the role of host genetics in the immune response to and control of WNV. The CC model includes eight founder mouse strains: five classical inbred strains (C57BL/6J, A/J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, and NZO/H1LuJ) and three wild-type-derived strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">â</xref><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The founder strains represent the three major <italic>Mus musculus</italic> subspecies, and genotyping has revealed that the founder strains capture nearly 90% of common genetic variation in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> strains (&gt;40 million SNPs, &gt;4 million small insertion/deletions), with this variation randomly distributed across the genome (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Recombinant inbred (RI) strains were created by three generations of funnel breeding to incorporate all founder lines, followed by at least 20 generations of inbred mating to develop each CC RI line (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.Â 2</xref>). For this study, F1 progeny from crosses between CC RI strains (called discovery recombinant intercross, or dRIX, lines) were used. These dRIX lines were heterozygous for the H-2<sup>b</sup> major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype and were created by crossing two independent RI lines, one of which had the H-2<sup>b</sup> allele, in order to allow for the detection of WNV-specific T cells by using MHC class I tetramer. Following MHC WNV infection and a complete phenotyping analysis of the innate and adaptive immune responses, various immune responses associated with a range of clinical outcomes were observed in the dRIX lines.</p>

      <p>Here, we demonstrate that the CC model can be used as a resource to model WNV infection in humans, such that infection and comparison of CC mouse lines improves upon information from inbred mouse models to better capture the diversity of WNV infection outcomes observed across the genetically diverse human population. We studied mice over a time course designed to encompass the range of WNV-induced disease outcomes as well as innate and adaptive immune response induction, peak response, and immune memory cell differentiation. Using these approaches, we identified three broad categories of WNV susceptibility (asymptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic with CNS involvement) within CC mice that mirrored the range of disease states in human infection. We show that the CC offers an effective model of WNV infection that captures the outcome diversity observed in the human population and that can be further used to identify unique correlates of protection from WNV infection and disease.</p>

        <title>Disease phenotypes in CC dRIX mice.</title>
        <p>To evaluate WNV disease in the CC mice as well as their associated immune response phenotype, we challenged cohorts of CC dRIX lines with WNV-TX, and we identified three broad categories of WNV disease outcomes based on weight loss and clinical disease score, viral loads in WNV target organs, including the spleen, brain, and kidney, and brain pathology based on histologic assessment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">TableÂ 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3</xref>). Strains classified as asymptomatic showed virtually no outward signs of disease, as seen by an absence of weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3A</xref>) and consistent clinical scores of zero. In these RIX animals, virus was quickly cleared from the spleen by day 7 postinfection, with minimal viral escape to the CNS at early time points and only one mouse showing low levels of virus reaching the brain at day 12. Despite a robust innate immune response, some mice might have experienced viral escape to the CNS, marked by <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> and <italic>IFIT1</italic> (interferon-induced tetracopeptide 1 gene) induction [CC(017 Ã 004)F1], but brain histopathology showed few to no signs of inflammation or parenchymal damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4</xref>). In contrast, symptomatic RIX mice began losing significant weight and showed increased clinical scores through the early infection time points, beginning at days 7 to 12 postinfection. In symptomatic RIX lines, viral loads in the CNS increased from day 4 to day 7 postinfection, and there was neuropathology characterized by perivascular mononuclear cuffing and infiltration with parenchymal lesions (combinations of degeneration, malacia, and apoptosis/necrosis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3C</xref>). The third category of WNV disease revealed by the RIX infection model was a response defined as âasymptomatic with CNS involvement.â Outwardly, these mice appeared to be asymptomatic, as there was little to no weight loss or signs of clinical disease, and limited viral escape resulted in <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> and <italic>IFIT1</italic> induction in the CNS and viral clearance, as in asymptomatic mice. However, brain histology examining immunopathology in the CNS, along with brain flow cytometry assays, revealed the presence of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> immune cells in the CNS, as seen in neuroinvasive WNV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3C</xref> and 5). However, despite neuroinvasive infection and CNS immunopathology, the mice showed no outward signs of disease. Thus, the outcome termed asymptomatic with CNS involvement represents a previously unmodeled but critical disease outcome that may represent a correlate to WNV-infected humans with limited disease symptoms or subclinical infection.</p>

        <p>The extent of innate immune activation in the different RIX lines was measured by assessing relative expression levels of the <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> and <italic>IFIT1</italic> genes. While both <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> and <italic>IFIT1</italic> are IRF3 target genes (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) induced by WNV infection, <italic>IFIT1</italic> is further induced by IFN signaling, thus allowing us to mark induction of IRF-3 activation and the IFN response. We monitored the expression of each gene in various mouse tissues to mark sites of IRF-3 activity and IFN response. In the asymptomatic lines CC(041 Ã 012)F1 and CC(017 Ã 004)F1, early <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> expression was observed in the kidney along with increased IFIT1 expression in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4A and B</xref>). At later time points, days 7 and 12 postinfection, <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> and <italic>IFIT1</italic> expression levels were generally lower except for in the brains of the asymptomatic lineÂ CC(017 Ã 004)F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4A</xref>, bottom). Higher (&gt;50Ã relative expression) <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> or <italic>IFIT1</italic> expression levels in the brains at later time points were associated with WNV susceptibility, as was seen in the symptomatic lines CC(005 Ã 001)F1 and CC(024 Ã 023)F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4</xref>). In the asymptomatic with CNS involvement line [CC(004 Ã 011)F1], high <italic>IFIT1</italic> expression was observed early (day 2) and expression was lower by day 7 and day 12, with <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> expression elevated in the spleen and kidney by day 12. In summary, early innate responses that resolved by day 7 were observed in asymptomatic lines, whereas the presence of a prolonged innate response (day 7 through day 12) correlated with a lack of peripheral virus control and viral spread to the brain.</p>

WNV-specific IgM was variable among groups; while one symptomatic strain showed no increase in IgM concentration over the time course of infection [CC(024 Ã 023)F1], a second symptomatic line [CC(005 Ã 001)F1] had higher baseline titers that increased through the early immune response (days 7 to 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5A</xref>) and then returned to baseline by days 21 to 28.

In the two asymptomatic lines, CD8<sup>+</sup> tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells specific to the immunodominant NS4B epitope expanded in the spleen at days 7 to 12 and then this cell population contracted by day 28. The dRIX line presenting with asymptomatic WNV infection with CNS involvement, CC(004 Ã 011)F1, showed high numbers of bulk CD8 T cells as well as antigen-specific T cells in the brain throughout the adaptive immune response to infection, as the cells remained in the brain at elevated levels through the day 28 time point. Again, we observed differences among phenotypes with the two symptomatic lines: while lineÂ CC(005 Ã 001)F1 showed higher levels of antigen-specific cells in both the spleen and brain at later time points (days 21 to 28), tetramer-positive cells failed to reach the brain in most mice of lineÂ CC(024 Ã 023)F1 by day 12 postinfection.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>We have identified three broadly categorized WNV disease outcomes, including asymptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic with CNS involvement, modeled by multiple dRIX lines that well represent the wide range of WNV disease states and immune variability observed in the human population compared to the C57BL/6J mouse model. Importantly, we show that multiple CC lines model each of the disease categories, and there are differences in WNV immune parameters both between these disease states that track with outcome as well as differences within each state that reveal a continuum of innate and adaptive immune responses that are associated with differential WNV susceptibility and disease. More generally, these responses suggest that complex genetic interactions drive these differential initial/innate antiviral responses, as well as the overall control of <italic>in vivo</italic> viral disease responses. Thus, our studies highlight the need for WNV disease models wherein a wider heterogeneity of responses is recapitulated, such as the CC model used in this study.</p>
      <p>We measured <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> induction as markers of innate immune response activation in WNV target organs, including the spleen and brain, as well as in the kidney as a representative organ that becomes involved during unrestrained viral replication. Early induction of <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> and/or <italic>IFIT1</italic> occurred in the kidney and spleen of lines that were either asymptomatic or asymptomatic with CNS involvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4A and B</xref>). These observations might simply reflect the host response to continued low-level viral replication suppressed by the innate immune response in these organs, or they could imply broader innate immune regulation wherein the dRIX mice differentially regulate their respective innate immune response via altered expression of negative regulatory factors of innate immune signaling and/or differential sensitivity to viral products that confer RLR or TLR signaling. The CC model allows for identification of either possibility, based on our ongoing studies to define expression of quantitative trait loci and individual genes of innate immune regulation that impart differential outcomes to WNV infection.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that due to the genetic heterogeneity among CC dRIX animals, we would observe differences in immune responses both between, and more importantly within, our disease state groups. For example, while our asymptomatic lines were comparable when assessed by weight loss, viral titers, and IFN-Î² expression in spleen, the IFN-Î² expression in the brain in lineÂ CC(017 Ã004)F1 showed continued expression through day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4A</xref>, bottom). While the significance of this nuance in <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> gene induction is unclear at this point, we speculate that it could impart differentially broad ISG expression set points among mouse lines with altered WNV susceptibility. These results demonstrate that there are intragroup differences in our broad âasymptomatic,â âsymptomatic,â and âasymptomatic with CNS involvementâ classifications that would more accurately capture the breadth of phenotypes observed in human populations than by current mouse models.</p>
      <p>Our analysis of the role of <italic>Oas1b</italic> status further highlights the importance of other genetic factors in driving a range of WNV responses. As mentioned above, polymorphisms at <italic>Oas1b</italic> have been shown to drive resistance to flaviviral infections in mice (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, genetic variation in OAS family members, such as <italic>Oas1</italic>, the putative human homologue to <italic>Oas1b</italic>, have been shown to influence WNV disease (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), as well as dengue (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and hepatitis C virus (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) in humans. However, despite the dominant role of Oas1/Oas1b in these populations in driving overall symptoms/susceptibility to WNV, there remains a range of pathogenic differences in both the human population as well as in our CC RIX lines, even among CC RIX group with identical <italic>Oas1b</italic> allele classifications. This can be seen most clearly in the heterozygous CC RIX class <italic>Oas1b.</italic> These RIXes all have one wild-type, or functional, <italic>Oas1b</italic> allele yet show a range of susceptibility responses, including the highly novel CC RIX line that showed CNS involvement without clinical symptoms. Such divergent outcomes despite sharing <italic>Oas1b</italic> alleles reinforces the notion that the ISG expression set point or altered innate immune regulation among hosts can likely contribute to differential outcome of infection and immunity among a population outbreak and that Oas1b is often not entirely sufficient to completely protect against WNV infection. These various responses mirror the variation seen within the human population and highlight the critical nature of population-based approaches, such as CC studies, in better understanding the underlying genetic architecture driving wide ranges of disease responses, even within individuals sharing major resistance loci (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our adaptive immune response studies also revealed intra- and interdisease state heterogeneity in immune responses. For example, in some asymptomatic strains there are large numbers of WNV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells present within the central nervous system, while in some there are not, and the same is true for symptomatic strains. Additionally, the kinetics and functionality of the T-cell response vary by strain and within disease state categories. The humoral immune response to WNV is also variable, depending on the strain examined. Though in general symptomatic strains have a lower WNV-specific IgM response in the blood at 7Â days postinfection, this correlation is not always present, suggesting that WNV-specific IgM can be a correlate of protection but is not the only critical player in a successful immune response to WNV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5</xref>). Previous studies have shown that higher levels of Tregs after infection protect against severe WNV disease in both mice and humans (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Interestingly, one of our asymptomatic strains presented with high levels of Tregs at baseline in the CNS, which is unique for this immune-privileged environment. After infection, the Tregs expanded even further, and there was no sign of CNS immunopathology by histology or via an expansion of antigen-specific CD8 T cells, potentially suggesting a mechanism by which Tregs limit the immune response to WNV infection in the CNS when infection is controlled in the periphery by innate and humoral responses.</p>
      <p>Many additional immune phenotypes of WNV infection can be been measured, in both the periphery and CNS, to give a more complete understanding of the adaptive immune response to WNV. Through the use of the CC mice, we have observed a much wider range in phenotypes than previously seen in the B6 model, and importantly, these phenotypes mirror human symptoms and immune responses. While a limited discussion of the broad classifications of immune phenotypes is presented here, many additional aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response are being measured and can be combined with genomics analysis in future downstream studies. Our findings demonstrate that with the genetic diversity provided by the CC model, we can tease out several specific phenotypes that are present in humans but previously unable to be studied in a mouse model, such as asymptomatic mice with CNS involvement. The CC model allows us to link these outcomes with host genotype to identify genes of susceptibility and protection from WNV infection and disease. Extensive analyses of the CC and other mouse strains with rare phenotypes may elucidate how genetic differences affect both susceptibility and the kinetics of the innate and adaptive response to viral infection. Such approaches will serve to assist in identifying unique correlates of protection from neuroinvasive viral infections to inform therapeutic and vaccine strategies for controlling WNV infection in humans.</p>

        <p>The clinical scoring system to evaluate WNV-infected mice was as follows: 0, healthy mouse (baseline); 1, ruffled fur, lethargy, hunched posture, no paresis, normal gait; 2, altered gait, limited movement in one hind limb; 3, lack of movement, paresis in one or both hind limbs; 4, moribund. Based on weight loss, clinical scoring, and brain histology, CC dRIX lines segregated into three broad categories: asymptomatic (asympt), symptomatic (sympt), and asymptomatic with CNS involvement (asympt-CNS). Symptomatic was defined as a weight loss â¥10% and/or any death, whereas asymptomatic was defined as a weight loss of &gt;10% and no death. CNS histopathologic involvement was evaluated by a veterinary pathologist. The CC dRIX lines featured in this study were CC(041 Ã 012)F1 and CC(017 Ã 004)F1 (asympt), CC(005 Ã 001)F1 and CC(024 Ã 023)F1 (sympt), and CC(004 Ã 011)F1 (asympt-CNS).</p>
