        <p>Key pathophysiology of sickle cell anaemia includes compensatory erythropoiesis, vascular
injury and chronic inflammation, which divert amino acids from tissue deposition for
growth/weight gain and muscle formation. We hypothesised that sickle mice maintained on an
isoenergetic diet with a high percentage of energy derived from protein (35 %), as opposed
to a standard diet with 20 % of energy derived from protein, would improve body
composition, bone mass and grip strength. Male Berkeley transgenic sickle mice (S;
<italic>n</italic> 8–12) were fed either 20 % (S20) or 35 % (S35) diets for 3 months.
Grip strength (BIOSEB meter) and body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan)
were measured. After 3 months, control mice had the highest bone mineral density (BMD) and
bone mineral content (BMC) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0·005). S35 mice had the largest
increase in grip strength. A two-way ANOVA of change in grip strength
(<italic>P</italic> = 0·043) attributed this difference to genotype
(<italic>P</italic> = 0·025) and a trend in type of diet (<italic>P</italic> = 0·067).
<sc>l</sc>-Arginine (<sc>l</sc>-Arg) supplementation of the 20 % diet was explored, as a
possible mechanism for improvement obtained with the 35 % diet. Townes transgenic sickle
mice (TS; <italic>n</italic> 6–9) received 0·8, 1·6, 3·2 or 6·4 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg based on
the same protocol and outcome measures used for the S mice. TS mice fed 1·6 %
<sc>l</sc>-Arg for 3 months (TS1.6) had the highest weight gain, BMD, BMC and lean body
mass compared with other groups. TS3.2 mice showed significantly more improvement in grip
strength than TS0·8 and TS1.6 mice (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0·05). In conclusion, the
high-protein diet improved body composition and grip strength. Outcomes observed with
TS1.6 and TS3.2 mice, respectively, confirm the hypothesis and reveal <sc>l</sc>-Arg as
part of the mechanism.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a genetic disorder of Hb, affecting the structure and function
of erythrocytes. In response to certain physiological conditions, such as hypoxia,
erythrocytes assume a sickled shape and become less adaptable<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. These abnormal erythrocytes adhere to vessels and restrict blood flow,
causing endothelial injuries, vaso-occlusive crises associated with pain, and ultimate end
organ damage<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Together, subclinical endothelial injury, erythropoiesis, transient
vaso-occlusive events and increased intra-vascular haem from haemolysis promote steady-state
inflammation in SCA patients<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
    <p>Haemolysis catalyses the generation of reactive oxygen species, which decrease NO
availability. In the body, <sc>l</sc>-arginine (<sc>l</sc>-Arg) is an amino acid required for
protein synthesis, urea and NO production<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The functions of <sc>l</sc>-Arg are many, including growth and muscle
development<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, making it a semi-essential amino acid based on the stage of development.
Both mice<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> and human subjects<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> with sickle cell disease typically have low Arg levels associated with
vasoconstriction and several attendant complications, including acute chest syndrome. In SCA,
Arg metabolism is shifted towards increased urea production<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, limiting NO production. The increased presence of haem also scavenges NO
leading to vasoconstriction promoting hypoxia and organ damage<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> and causing an increase in proinflammatory markers.</p>
    <p>The inflammatory response is associated with hypermetabolism<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> and muscle proteolysis<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. During muscle proteolysis<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> pro-inflammatory IL-6 initiates the synthesis of acute-phase proteins,
which require increased amino acid uptake<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> to further propagate the chronic inflammatory response. Increased energy
demands of haemolysis, inflammation and other steady-state complications affect the growth and
development of SCA patients<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Children with SCA have significantly lower body weight, height, bone
mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) compared with healthy
controls<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. These processes increase the nutritional requirements for SCA patients,
making an otherwise normal dietary intake insufficient<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> to maintain growth and development, as often observed among SCA
patients<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
    <p>This idea is supported by findings from our previous work examining a series of diets with
15–35 % energy from protein, where sickle mice maintained on a 35 % energy from protein diet
increased weight gain and decreased baseline inflammatory indicators, C-reactive protein and
IL-6 and liver arginase activity<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. An important next step was to examine the impact of the diet on body
composition, since the original premise that the increased proportion of energy derived from
protein would promote weight gain had been confirmed<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our hypothesis was that sickle mice maintained on a test diet with a high
proportion of energy supplied as protein (35 %) <italic>v.</italic> a standard diet with 20 %
energy supplied as protein would improve body composition and improve bone structure and grip
strength, while sustaining erythropoietic activity. Berkeley transgenic sickle mice (S mice)
developed by Pászty <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> were used for the present study because only human α- and sickle β-globins
are transgenically expressed in these mice, providing a suitable <italic>in vivo</italic>
model to examine salient characteristics of clinical SCA. It was also considered that
<sc>l</sc>-Arg could have a role in any improvement in body composition observed, due to
increased <sc>l</sc>-Arg availability from increased dietary protein, for muscle protein
synthesis, tissue replacement and repair.</p>
    <p>The focus of the present research was therefore to investigate the effect of the high-protein
diet on body composition, including bone mass and grip strength. The pattern of these outcomes
would then be used as a guide for determining expected outcomes when investigating a possible
role for increased <sc>l</sc>-Arg availability from the high-protein diet. The <sc>l</sc>-Arg
effect was determined by supplementing the standard 20 % energy from protein diet with
increasing doses of <sc>l</sc>-Arg, to determine if there was also a dose–response effect on
the outcome measures. We hypothesised that increasing the amount of <sc>l</sc>-Arg in the
diet, would improve body composition and grip strength beyond that achieved by sickle mice
maintained only on the standard diet. Confirmation of this hypothesis would suggest a role for
<sc>l</sc>-Arg as a component of the high-protein diet, in facilitating physiological
changes in body composition. Townes<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> sickle (TS) mice were used to examine <sc>l</sc>-Arg supplementation, and,
like S mice<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, express human sickle Hb exclusively, erythrocyte sickling, severe anaemia
and progressive organ pathology as in humans with SCA<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">

        <title>Mice</title>
        <p>Male S mice (<italic>n</italic> 8–12) were used in a prospective controlled terminal
feeding trial. The S mouse model is derived from a mixed genetic background (FVB/N, 129,
DBA/2, C57BL/6, Black Swiss)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. C57BL/6 mice (C; <italic>n</italic> 8–12) were therefore used as
controls. Whereas laboratory mice generally grow optimally on a 20 % energy from protein
diet, our preliminary studies confirmed that sickle mice grew best on a 35 % energy from
protein diet<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore for the first aim of the present study we compared the
effect of a 35 % energy from protein diet with a 20 % energy from protein diet on body
composition of both C and S mice. TS mice (<italic>n</italic> 6–9) were utilised for the
second aim<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> to investigate the effect of <sc>l</sc>-Arg supplementation because
our collaborators were switching from the Berkeley colony to the Townes model. Both

murine α-model with a β-globin model. The research groups independently bred the resulting
model with both murine knockouts, to developed mice carrying human
transgenes<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">

appropriate for the outcomes investigated in the present study.</p>
        <p>Weanling mice (aged about 4 weeks old) were typically housed four per cage for 1 week of
acclimatisation followed by 3 months of feeding. Specially designed cages, separating
wasted food crumbs from urine, faeces and bedding were used to allow calculation of the
actual amount of feed consumed by the mice per cage. All guidelines for the care and use
of animals were followed and The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Emory
University and Morehouse School of Medicine approved all experimental procedures.</p>

        <title>Study design</title>
        <p>The study was designed as a prospective controlled terminal feeding trial. The
requirement of eight mice per group was based on an 80 % power calculation with an α of
0·05. For all feeding experiments mice were randomly assigned to any of the selected
diets. After weaning, the mice were allowed to acclimatise to their diets: standard 20 %
or test 35 % diet and 0·8 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg, 1·6 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg, 3·2 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg, or
6·4 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg for 1 week.</p>
        <p>Diets were supplied by Purina Mills TestDiet Division. For the diet supplying 20 % energy
as protein, diet TD 1813657 was used, which contained (g/kg diet): vitamin-free casein,
223·0; dextrin, 353·0; <sc>l</sc>-Arg, 8·0; energy (kJ/kg diet), 15271·6. For the diet
supplying 35 % energy as protein, diet TD 1813675 was used, which contained (g/kg diet):
vitamin-free casein, 392·0; dextrin, 184·0; <sc>l</sc>-Arg, 13·7; energy (kJ/kg diet),
14853·2. Identical components were: sucrose, 157·0; glucose, 107·0; maize oil, 40·0;
powdered cellulose, 50·0; American Institute of Nutrition (AIN) 93M mineral mix, 10·0;
<sc>l</sc>-cystine, 3·0; choline bitartrate, 2·0.</p>
        <p>For the 0·8 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg diet, diet TD 1813657 was used (g/kg diet): dextrin, 353·0;
<sc>l</sc>-Arg, 8·0; energy (kJ/kg diet), 15271·6. For the 1·6 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg diet,
diet TD 1813672 was used (g/kg diet): dextrin, 343·0; <sc>l</sc>-Arg, 16·0; energy (kJ/kg
diet), 15230·0. For the 3·2 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg diet, diet TD 1813673 was used (g/kg diet):
dextrin, 324·0; <sc>l</sc>-Arg, 32·0; energy (kJ/kg diet), 15188·0. For the 6·4 %

64·0; energy (kJ/kg diet), 15062·0. Identical components were: vitamin-free casein, 223·0
and those previously stated for the 20 % and 35 % protein diets.</p>
        <p>All mice were then fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 3 months and monitored daily to
ensure general health. Three mice died as a result of sickle cell complications in the 3·2
% <sc>l</sc>-Arg treatment group. The information collected before death was used in the
analysis of food intake. Food consumption corrected for spillage was recorded and weekly
body weights were measured. Body composition was determined by dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and grip strength was measured 0 to 3 d before the end of the
feeding period, using a transducer (both are designed for mice and detailed below). Blood
was also collected via tail clip to measure complete blood count using a veterinary
haematology analyser (Hematrue™; HESKA Lab Systems) and reticulocyte count via flow
cytometry (BD LSR II; BD Biosciences). After the DXA scan, the mice were killed by
isoflurane anaesthesia followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was then obtained by
cardiac puncture and stored for future use.</p>

        <title>Grip strength</title>
        <p>At the end of the feeding period, a validated grip strength test meter (BIOSEB; EB
Instruments) was used to measure the grip strength of all limbs<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">

period after 1 week of acclimatisation to the diet. During the grip strength test, the
mice were handled by their tails and placed over the grid until all paws grasped the grid.
The tail was then pulled horizontally until the mouse released hold entirely. Three
separate readings were recorded and averaged in Newtons, then converted to grams for
analysis. Change in grip strength was calculated by the difference between the initial
value after acclimatisation and the final value at 3 months.</p>

recovering from anaesthesia. Mice were anaesthetised using a ketamine (100 mg/kg)–xylazine
(10 mg/kg) mixture and positioned right side up on the plate. Whole-body DXA was
performed, which provided data for BMD (amount of mineral in bone within a certain
volume), BMC (the weight of minerals within bone), percentage fat (the percentage of fat
in the whole body) and lean body mass (LBM, the amount of lean mass in the whole body).

        <p>The mice were weighed before feeding commenced and the total weight gain was measured by
subtracting the final from the initial weight. The total weight of food supplied to the
mice over the study period was corrected for spillage and the quantity of food consumed
per cage was determined. Since the mice were not individually caged we added their weights
per cage to determine changes in weight gain in response to quantity of food consumed.
Weekly weight per cage was divided by weekly food consumption and the results were plotted
to illustrate differences in weight gain by type of diet.</p>

        <p>Statistical testing of normality for continuous variables revealed abnormal

Mann–Whitney test and the values are presented as mean values and standard deviations. To
determine the effect of the high-protein diet, a two-way ANOVA model of either total
weight gain or change in grip strength as outcome variables on mouse genotype, protein
level, and mouse genotype × protein level (the interaction term) was performed.
Kruskal–Wallis with a <italic>post hoc</italic> (Mann–Whitney) test was used to compare
the differences between mice on the <sc>l</sc>-Arg diet. We also compared S20 and TS mice
fed a 0·8 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg diet (TS0.8) to determine the effect of type of transgenic

perform this baseline measurement on additional diets because the main interest was in
the outcome after 3 months of supplementing the control diet with <sc>l</sc>-Arg. The
mean values from the DXA scan before supplementation were: BMD 0·034 (<sc>sd</sc> 0·002)

results, TS1.6 mice had higher body composition values in all components and TS3.2 mice
had higher percentage fat. Comparison of the two mouse models (S <italic>v.</italic> TS)
demonstrated that before supplementation TS0·8 mice had significantly higher BMD and BMC

higher percentage fat (<italic>P</italic> = 0·001). However, the overall pattern of
change during the experiments was similar for both models. Each intervention, i.e.
increasing the proportion of energy derived from protein of the diet or supplementing
the diet with <sc>l</sc>-Arg, improved weight gain, body composition and grip strength
in mice with SCA. <fig id="fig04" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of <sc>l</sc>-arginine (<sc>l</sc>-Arg) diets on body composition. Weight

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of a high-protein diet and
increased <sc>l</sc>-Arg on body composition and grip strength in sickle mice. It was our
hypothesis that both a high-protein diet and increased <sc>l</sc>-Arg would provide
additional nutrients that sickle mice might need to improve a characteristically slower rate
of weight gain<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, which would probably result in inadequate LBM and hence less strength
for the use of limbs. These results, for the first time, illustrate that dietary
supplementation can improve body composition and limb grip strength in transgenic sickle
mouse models. The incremental dosage of <sc>l</sc>-Arg also revealed that increased Arg
provided significant improvements in total weight gain and body composition in the TS mouse
model. The dosage of Arg that yielded the most significant improvements was the 1·6 %
<sc>l</sc>-Arg diet, which is equivalent to the amount supplied in the high-protein (35 %
energy from protein) diet. The TS mice remained anaemic with high reticulocyte counts
despite the type of diet consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).
Therefore it is reasonable to suggest that increased Arg supplied extra energy for improved
weight gain and body composition, while continuing to drive erythropoiesis.</p>
      <p>Our previous studies showed that S mice need more energy from dietary protein than C
mice<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, concurring with clinical investigations signalling an increased energy
need in SCA and corresponding dietary energy shortage<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>35</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was also found that the diet with the high proportion of energy
derived from protein (35 %) was more beneficial for sickle mice than the standard mouse
diet<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, by improving weight gain and reducing inflammatory biomolecules. The
high-protein diet decreased acute-phase and cytokine inflammatory markers after 3 months in
S mice<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>34</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, alluding to a possible mechanism to explain decreased infection rates
in children with SCA receiving supplements<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>34</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>36</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. What remained to be explored were the effects of a high-protein/energy
diet on body composition and a better understanding of what component(s) in the high-protein
diet may be responsible for improvements. Therefore, the present study was designed as a
natural extension of the initial work, to investigate the impact of the high-protein diet
and increased <sc>l</sc>-Arg on these additional nutritional complications that define
sickle cell disease. In the present study, S35 mice had higher mean values for total weight
gain, LBM and grip strength than S20 mice. The final grip strength for S mice surpassed that
for C20 mice. The basis for the small changes noted for grip strength in the C20 mice
compared with the other groups cannot be categorically identified, since there are many
factors contributing to grip strength. However, since these mice were consuming their
optimal diet we did not anticipate any significant improvement in their grip strength. An
aspect that has not been explored is physical activity. Throughout the study it was observed
that the sickle mice were more active than the control mice. It would be interesting to
monitor this behaviour to confirm if the difference in activity contributed appreciably to
the difference in grip strength when controlling for diet.</p>
      <p>Reports in the literature show that circulating levels of many amino acids are
significantly lower than normal for individuals with SCA<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>37</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>38</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of these, one conditionally essential amino acid of interest is
<sc>l</sc>-Arg, due to its impact on growth<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>39</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> and protein synthesis<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>40</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. We have shown that increased dietary Arg increased plasma
<sc>l</sc>-Arg levels in sickle mice while reducing liver arginase levels, suggesting a
shift in Arg metabolism toward less urea production<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, and possibly more in favour of NO formation, with potential positive
effects such as reducing vascular cell/cell adhesion and vaso-occlusion, therefore
facilitating increased blood flow, O<sub>2</sub> distribution and nutrient supply. Other
researchers, using a different sickle mouse model (S + S-Antilles) demonstrated that dietary
<sc>l</sc>-Arg supplementation improved physical performance and reasoned similarly that
this result could be related to increased NO synthesis, causing more vasodilatation and
blood flow by reducing ischaemia in the brain and/or muscle<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>41</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings encouraged the possibility that adding <sc>l</sc>-Arg to
the standard-protein diet could also improve body composition and, hence, grip strength. The
results of the present study demonstrate, for the first time, that S and TS mice
supplemented with dietary <sc>l</sc>-Arg improve body composition by dose–response, but not
in an expected incremental fashion. The 1·6 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg diet was associated with the
highest mean value for total weight gain and BMD, whereas the 3·2 % <sc>l</sc>-Arg diet was
associated with the largest change in grip strength. Therefore, the results of the
dose–response seem to be highlighting differences in <sc>l</sc>-Arg requirements for diverse
physiological processes. Collectively, the present study demonstrates that by supplying
additional nutrients required to reduce known protein/energy shortages, key pathological
events may be reduced and growth and development improved in SCA.</p>
      <p>We have examined the impact of diet on body composition of sickle mice by using the DXA
scan method. Children with SCA are reported to have significantly reduced whole-body BMC and
significant deficits in LBM<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. A similar pattern was observed in the present study, in which sickle
mice had significantly lower BMD and BMC than the control mice for both standard and
enriched diets. Comparing body composition of a separate set of mice at 7d with mice fed the
respective diet for 3 months suggested more improvement in the S35 mice compared with S20
mice, suggesting a possibility for catch-up development, if the correct dietary requirement
can be determined. To address the question of temporal intra-individual body composition
change in transgenic sickle mice, it would be necessary to implement a technique not
requiring restraint that would eliminate risk of mortality when the animals are recovering
from anaesthesia. Comparison of the TS mouse model with S mice showed that the average BMD,
BMC and LBM were higher for TS mice. However, the improvements in body composition for
sickle mice on either a high-protein diet or increased <sc>l</sc>-Arg supplementation
support the hypothesis and raise the possibility that nutritional supplements may also
improve body composition and clinical status for individuals with SCA.</p>
      <p>These results concur with other reports about Arg supplementation, implying a benefit of
Arg for improved weight gain and BMD. Arg supplementation has been shown to increase
skeletal muscle content, decrease fat<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>42</sup>
</xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>44</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, improve weight gain and depress muscle protein
turnover<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>45</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> in other animal models. The results of the present study and findings
from other reports are encouraging and could be of translational value. The idea that
dietary supplementation of macronutrients could provide a widely available health benefit
for sickle cell patients warrants further exploration, especially as it is recognised that
micronutrients (i.e. vitamins and minerals) alone cannot replace the drain on protein and
energy resources associated with the rapid rate of erythrocyte renewal reported in the
literature<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>36</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>46</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. It will ultimately be important to develop RDA of protein and energy
and possibly other nutrients for this group of patients.</p>
      <p>In summary, there is often deficiency in several elements of body composition in children
and adults with SCA. These results show that feeding a diet with a high proportion of energy
derived from protein or adding <sc>l</sc>-Arg to the normal (control) diet helps improve,
but not resolve, nutritional deficiencies of sickle mice. We believe that increased
<sc>l</sc>-Arg or dietary protein beyond that supplied in the standard diet is allowing
sickle mice to satisfy some of the increased nutrient demands while facilitating improved
growth and repair. The combined results of our previous and current research suggest that
the increased-protein diet provides amino acids that are otherwise limited in sickle cell
disease for normal growth and body composition. Results from the <sc>l</sc>-Arg
supplementation confirm that increased <sc>l</sc>-Arg availability and metabolism are part
of the mechanism by which the high-protein diet improved body composition in the sickle
mice. The use of the two transgenic sickle cell mouse models revealed significantly higher
mean values for body composition (i.e. BMD, BMC and percentage body fat) for TS
<italic>v.</italic> S mice. However, the pattern of change by diet was similar for both
models. Although both the high-protein diet and increased-<sc>l</sc>-Arg diet improved the
physical condition of sickle cell mice, adequate formulation for effective dietary
supplementation of SCA patients remains to be studied and reported. These data in sickle
mice suggest that a nutritional approach based mainly on increased energy intake and
supplementing deficient amino acids could offer significant benefits in the management of
sickle cell disease patients and, if proven in the clinical setting, should perhaps become
part of the usual treatment regimen.</p>
