      <abstract>
        <p>TLR2 promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation via an early MyD88-IRAK1-dependent pathway that provides a priming signal (signal 1) necessary for activation of the inflammasome by a second potassium-depleting signal (signal 2). Here we show that TLR3 binding to dsRNA promotes post-translational inflammasome activation through intermediate and late TRIF/RIPK1/FADD-dependent pathways. Both pathways require the scaffolding but not the catalytic function of caspase-8 or RIPK1. Only the late pathway requires kinase competent RIPK3 and MLKL function. Mechanistically, FADD/caspase-8 scaffolding function provides a post-translational signal 1 in the intermediate pathway, whereas in the late pathway it helps the oligomerization of RIPK3, which together with MLKL provides both signal 1 and 2 for inflammasome assembly. Cytoplasmic dsRNA activates NLRP3 independent of TRIF, RIPK1, RIPK3 or mitochondrial DRP1, but requires FADD/caspase-8 in wildtype macrophages to remove RIPK3 inhibition. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of pathways that lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to dsRNA.</p>

    <p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that sense a broad range of microbial ligands leading to NF-ÎºB and IRF3 activation and expression of genes involved in inflammation and other immune responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. TLR activation also leads to cell death and inflammasome activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. TLR signalling involves homo- or hetero-dimerization of TLRs to bring their TIR domains in close proximity to each other, allowing the recruitment of specific TIR domain-containing adaptor molecules such as MyD88, TRIF, TIRAP (also called Mal) and TRAM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. All TLRs associate directly or indirectly with MyD88 except for TLR3, which associates with TRIF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. TLR4 is the only TLR that can associate with both TRIF and MyD88 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p>
    <p>On binding of TLR3 to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), it recruits TRIF through TIRâTIR homotypic domain interactions resulting in TRIF oligomerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Several outcomes follow this interaction in macrophages, depending on the composition of the complexes that are nucleated by oligomerized TRIF. Formation of a TRIFâTRAF6 complex results in TAK1 activation with subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and NF-ÎºB; whereas, formation of TRIFâTRAF3 activates TBK1 and IKKÉ, and subsequent activation of type I interferons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. A third complex can also form by direct interaction of TRIF with either RIPK1 or RIPK3 through their respective RHIM domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In cultured murine macrophages, low levels of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein results in a TRIFâRIPK1 complex, which recruits FADD and caspase-8 leading to induction of apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. When caspase-8 activity is compromised, this complex recruits RIPK3 to drive MLKL-dependent necroptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In other cultured cells such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts, TRIF may directly recruit RIPK3 to initiate necroptosis independent of RIPK1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p>
    <p>NLRP3 is a member of the NLR family of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. NLRP3 directs the assembly of an inflammasome complex with ASC and procaspase-1 after receiving a priming signal (or signal 1) from TLRs and a second signal (or signal 2) from purinergic receptors or pore-forming toxins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Our recent studies showed that acute TLR2 stimulation triggers a rapid signalling pathway dependent on MyD88, IRAK1 and IRAK4, that leads to post-translational priming of NLRP3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Interestingly, a second, slightly delayed TLR3- and TRIF-dependent pathway, can also lead to post-translational priming of NLRP3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), but the particular signalling steps involved in this novel pathway remain unknown.</p>
    <p>Here we dissect the signal transduction pathways involved in the post-translational priming of NLRP3 by TLR3 signalling in response to extracellular dsRNA in macrophages. We show that TLR3 stimulation can activate two pathways that promote NLRP3 activation, intermediate and late, depending on the nature of the signalling molecules recruited downstream of the TRIFâRIPK1 complex. Caspase-8 scaffolding function, but not its catalytic activity, is crucial in both pathways, whereas RIPK3/MLKL activity is only required for the late pathway. We further show that cytoplasmic dsRNA can also promote NLRP3 activation through a distinct pathway that requires FADD/caspase-8 in wildtype (WT) macrophages, but not in RIPK3-deficient macrophages. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathways activated by dsRNA and provide the first example of signalling by the FADDâcaspase-8 complex independent of its catalytic activity.</p>

        <title>NLRP3 priming by TLR3 requires TRIF/RIPK1/FADD/caspase-8</title>
        <p>Our recent studies showed that stimulation of TLR3 with the synthetic dsRNA poly(I:C) primes NLRP3 activation through a post-translational, TRIF-dependent pathway designated âintermediate pathway'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, stimulation of TLR2 with Pam3CSK4 primes NLRP3 activation through a post-translational, MyD88âIRAK4âIRAK1-dependent pathway designated âearly or rapid pathway'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Consistent with these findings, ATP-activated caspase-1 in WT macrophages when added 30â60âmin after TLR3 stimulation with poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, middle panels). Very little activation occurred when ATP was added 10 or 180âmin after poly(I:C) stimulation, indicating that maximum inflammasome activation occurred within an intermediate time window of 30â60âmin following TLR3âTRIF activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). A more rapid activation of caspase-1 occurred when ATP was added 10âmin after stimulation of the TLR2âMyD88 pathway with Pam3CSK4 but declined at 30âmin or later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, left panels). As expected, robust caspase-1 activation occurred when ATP was added at all treatment times following TLR4 stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which activates both the MyD88 and TRIF pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, right panels).</p>
        <p>To further investigate the TLR3 signalling component(s) contributing to this activation pattern, we performed similar time course studies in macrophages deficient in known signalling molecules downstream of TRIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1bâg</xref>). RIPK1 and RIPK3 are involved in necroptosis signalling by TLR3 in macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Similar to the TRIF-knockout (TRIF-KO) macrophages, stimulation of RIPK1-KO macrophages with poly(I:C) plus ATP failed to induce the pattern of caspase-1 activation observed in WT macrophages, although these cells had a normal response to Pam3CSK4 plus ATP or LPS plus ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). However, unlike the TRIF-KO macrophages, there was a weak caspase-1 activation in the RIPK1-KO at the 60 and 180âmin time points and no decline in caspase-1 activation at the same time points in response to LPS plus ATP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This could be explained by the recent findings that TRIF can recruit RIPK3 directly in the absence of RIPK1 when TLR3 or TLR4 are stimulated resulting in activation of a TRIFâRIPK3âMLKL pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, which is likely responsible for this late activation of caspase-1. In contrast to RIPK1 or TRIF-KO macrophages, RIPK3-KO macrophages showed normal caspase-1 activation in response to the inducers tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Considering that RIPK1 is an adaptor protein that recruits FADD and caspase-8 to activate apoptosis, we examined whether FADD or caspase-8 deficiency impacts TLR3-mediated NLRP3 activation. Given that FADD or caspase-8 deficiency is embryonic lethal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and unleashes RIPK3-mediated necroptosis, we employed macrophages from either FADD/RIPK3 or caspase-8/RIPK3 double knockout (DKO) mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Notably, like TRIF-KO macrophages, FADD/RIPK3-DKO and caspase-8/RIPK3-DKO macrophages failed to activate caspase-1 in response to poly(I:C) plus ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>, middle panels) even though both lines showed caspase-1 activation in response to Pam3CSK4 plus ATP or LPS plus ATP, although there was a time-dependent loss of sensitivity to LPS plus ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>, left and right panels). Similar results were obtained with caspase-8/RIPK1/RIPK3 triple knockout (TKO) macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that post-translational priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome by extracellular dsRNA through the intermediate pathway requires RIPK1, FADD and caspase-8.</p>

        <title>dsRNA and signal 2 induce NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis</title>
        <p>Activation of caspase-1 by the inflammasomes can lead to pyroptotic cell death in macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, which can be measured by assaying the activity of released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture medium. Consistent with the caspase-1 activation patterns described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), activation of the intermediate pathway with poly(I:C) and ATP-induced LDH release from WT and RIPK3-KO, but failed to induce significant release of LDH from TRIF-KO, RIPK1-KO, caspase-8/RIPK3-DKO or caspase-8/RIPK1/RIPK3-TKO macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In contrast, normal LDH release was observed in WT and all of these knockout macrophages in response to Pam3CSK4 and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results indicate that activation of the inflammasome by extracellular dsRNA and ATP can lead to TRIF/RIPK1/caspase-8-dependent pyroptotic cell death.</p>
        <p>Extracellular dsRNA is normally produced by virally infected cells especially when they are infected with dsRNA viruses like rotaviruses. Rotaviruses infect the gastrointestinal tract and this can frequently coincide with co-infection with gram-positive bacteria such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> or other NLRP3-activating toxin-producing bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. <italic>Listeria</italic> is unable to activate NLRP3 through the intermediate pathway, but can activate it through the early MyD88-dependent pathway by simultaneously stimulating host TLR2âMyD88 signalling with its lipoprotein while disrupting host cell membrane by its pore-forming listeriolysin O (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). However, in the presence of viral dsRNA it might activate NLRP3 via the intermediate pathway. To test this possibility we infected WT, NLRP3-KO and MyD88-KO macrophages with <italic>Listeria</italic> with or without prior priming with poly(I:C). <italic>Listeria</italic> was not able to activate caspase-1 in MyD88-KO or NLRP3-KO macrophages, but was able to activate it in MyD88-KO macrophages primed with poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). However, Listeria activated caspase-1 in WT macrophages both with or without prior priming with poly(I:C), although there was notably enhanced activation in the presence of poly(I:C) compared with in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, right panels). Activation of caspase-1 by <italic>Listeria</italic> was associated with induction of pyroptosis as determined by LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These results suggest that gram-positive bacteria, which possess pore-forming toxins that can act as a signal 2 for NLRP3 activation, are able to activate NLRP3 through the intermediate pathway when this pathway is stimulated by viral dsRNA, which acts as a signal 1. This scenario can likely happen in cases of co-infection with NLRP3-activating toxin-producing bacteria such as <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> or <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and dsRNA viruses such as rotavirus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p>

        <title>NLRP3 priming by TLR3 requires caspase-8 scaffolding function</title>
        <p>The role of caspase-8 in NLRP3 activation remains incompletely resolved. Studies in caspase-8 conditional knockout dendritic cells (caspase-8-cKO DCs) implicated caspase-8 as an inhibitor of RIPK3-mediated NLRP3 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, but these observations are clouded by the fact that caspase-8-compromise unleashes necroptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In contrast, studies with caspase-8/RIPK3-DKO macrophages and mice reveal a contribution of caspase-8 catalytic activity in NLRP3 activation that is independent of RIPK3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). To address the exact role of caspase-8 in NLRP3 activation we asked whether caspase-8 catalytic activity is required for the intermediate pathway of NLRP3 activation by extracellular dsRNA. We stimulated macrophages with poly(I:C) and ATP in the presence or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethylketone (zVAD). Because zVAD can inhibit caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation, we used the ASC polymerization assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> as an indicator of NLRP3 activation. Stimulation with poly(I:C) and ATP both in the presence or absence of zVAD induced high amounts of polymerized ASC in the pellet fractions of WT and RIPK3-KO, but not RIPK1-KO macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aâc</xref>), indicating that inhibition of caspase-8 activity does not interfere with the intermediate pathway of NLRP3 activation. The requirement for caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>), but not its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggests that caspase-8 scaffolding function regulates NLRP3 activation in the intermediate pathway.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, stimulation with poly(I:C) and ATP in the presence of zVAD induced high amounts of polymerized ASC in the pellet fraction of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aII</xref>, fifth lane) but not RIPK3-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3bII</xref>, fifth lane) macrophages at the 180âmin time point. This suggests that caspase-8 inhibition by zVAD leads to induction of a TRIFâRIPK1âRIPK3-dependent late pathway (180âmin) of NLRP3 activation in response to TLR3 signalling. The activation of this late pathway in WT macrophages caused a reduction in the amount of polymerized ASC at the 30â60âmin time points (intermediate pathway; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aII</xref>, third and fourth lanes) compared with the same time points in the absence of zVAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aI</xref>, third and fourth lanes). However, a similar reduction was not observed in the RIPK3-KO macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3bI</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3bII</xref>, third and fourth lanes), indicating that recruitment of RIPK3 to the TRIFâRIPK1 complex might interfere with the function or reduce the formation of the TRIFâRIPK1âFADDâcaspase-8 complex, which is required for priming of NLRP3 by the intermediate pathway.</p>
        <p>The pattern of polymerized ASC in response to stimulation with Pam3CSK4 and ATP followed a similar time course in WT, RIPK3 and RIPK1 macrophages, and there was very little difference in the presence or absence of zVAD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2aâc</xref>, panels I and II), indicating that caspase-8 does not play a role in this pathway.</p>

        <title>dsRNA and zVAD activate NLRP3 without signal 2</title>
        <p>NLRP3 activation requires two signals; one is derived from TLRs (signal 1) and a second signal (signal 2) is derived from purinergic receptors or pore-forming toxins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. To examine whether the observed poly(I:C)âzVAD-activated late pathway of inflammasome activation requires an exogenous signal 2 from P2X7 receptor, we stimulated WT macrophages with poly(I:C) and zVAD followed by treatment with or without ATP. Time course analysis of ASC polymerization showed that stimulation with poly(I:C) and zVAD alone was able to induce robust ASC polymerization comparable in magnitude to that observed when cells were further stimulated with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, left and middle panels). Poly(I:C) and zVAD stimulation without ATP treatment did not induce ASC polymerization in RIPK3-KO, TRIF-KO or NLRP3-KO macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, second to fourth panels from left ), providing additional support for the critical role of RIPK3, TRIF and NLRP3 in the late pathway of inflammasome activation.</p>
        <p>As the late pathway of ASC polymerization requires 3â4âh of poly(I:C) stimulation, we asked whether this pathway is dependent on transcriptional upregulation of NLRP3 or other inflammasome components. Treatment of cells with actinomycin D, a potent transcription inhibitor, did not reduce the amount of polymerized ASC in response to stimulation with poly(I:C) and zVAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, right panel). On the contrary, actinomycin D treatment increased the amount of polymerized ASC and accelerated its formation kinetics. Taken together, our results show that TLR3 stimulation in the presence of inactive caspase-8 can lead to a TRIFâRIPK1âRIPK3-dependent late pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation that is independent of exogenous signal 2 or new gene synthesis.</p>

        <title>RIPK3 kinase activity is required in the late pathway</title>
        <p>To examine whether the kinase activity of RIPK1 or RIPK3 is important for NLRP3 activation, we performed time course studies of NLRP3 activation in response to stimulation with Pam3CSK4, poly(I:C) or LPS in knock-in macrophages expressing kinase-dead RIPK1 (RIPK1-KD) or RIPK3 (RIPK3-KD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Both RIPK1-KD and RIPK3-KD macrophages had normal caspase-1 activation similar to WT macrophages in response to Pam3CSK4, poly(I:C) or LPS plus ATP stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3aâc</xref>), indicating that the kinase activity of RIPK1 or RIPK3 is not required for the early or intermediate pathway of NLRP3 priming. Similarly, RIPK1-KD macrophages had normal ASC polymerization similar to WT macrophages in response to poly(I:C) plus zVAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>, left panels), indicating that the kinase activity of RIPK1 is also not required for priming or activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the late pathway. However, although RIPK3-KD macrophages had normal ASC polymerization during the intermediate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, middle and right panels), they showed no ASC polymerization during the late pathway in response to poly(I:C) plus zVAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, left panels), indicating that the kinase activity of RIPK3 is important. Consistent with this, treatment of WT macrophages with the RIPK3-specific kinase inhibitor GSK'872 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) completely inhibited inflammasome activation by the RIPK3-dependent late pathway, but did not inhibit inflammasome activation by the RIPK3-independent early or intermediate pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Collectively, these results show that RIPK3 and its kinase activity are not required for priming of NLRP3 by the intermediate pathway, but both RIPK3 and its kinase activity are needed for priming and activation of NLRP3 by the late pathway. In addition, although RIPK1 is required as an adaptor for both the intermediate and late pathways of inflammasome activation, its kinase activity is dispensable.</p>

        <title>NLRP3 activation by dsRNA and zVAD requires MLKL</title>
        <p>MLKL is an important substrate for RIPK3 kinase activity, and its phosphorylation by RIPK3 leads to induction of necroptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Notably, MLKL-KO macrophages like RIPK3-KO macrophages are resistant to induction of necroptotic cell death by poly(I:C) plus zVAD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>), but they exhibit normal caspase-1 activation similar to that observed in WT macrophages in response to Pam3CSK4, poly(I:C) or LPS plus ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). As the late pathway of inflammasome activation requires the kinase activity of RIPK3, and as MLKL activation has been shown to trigger formation of plasma membrane pores<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, we asked whether MLKL could function as a signalling molecule that facilitates NLRP3 activation downstream of RIPK3 by virtue of its pore-forming activity. Time course studies of ASC polymerization in MLKL-KO macrophages in response to poly(I:C) in the presence of zVAD with or without ATP, showed an intact intermediate pathway but a defective late pathway of inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Similar studies in FADD/MLKL-DKO macrophages showed that these cells have both defective intermediate and late pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). These results indicate that intact necroptotic signalling controls activation of the late pathway and further demonstrate that FADD/caspase-8 signalling controls the intermediate pathway. The inability of ATP to stimulate ASC polymerization in the late pathway in MLKL-KO or FADD/MLKL-DKO macrophages suggests that simultaneous signalling by RIPK3 and MLKL is required to provide both signal 1 and signal 2 to activate NLRP3. Together, these results indicate that MLKL is not critical for inflammasome activation in the early or intermediate pathways, but is particularly required during the late TRIFâRIPK1âRIPK3-dependent pathway.</p>

        <title>RIPK3 oligomerization by dsRNA and zVAD requires caspase-8</title>
        <p>To further investigate the role of caspase-8 in the late pathway, we stably reconstituted immortalized RIPK3-KO and caspase-8/RIPK3-DKO macrophages with WT green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged RIPK3. Notably, stable expression of RIPK3-GFP in RIPK3-KO, but not in caspase-8/RIPK3-DKO macrophages sensitized them to poly(I:C) plus zVAD as evidenced by induction of ASC polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Intriguingly, confocal imaging of these macrophage lines after poly(I:C) plus zVAD treatment for 180âmin showed RIPK3 oligomerization (aggregation) only in the RIPK3-GFP-reconstituted RIPK3-KO but not in the caspase-8/RIPK3-DKO macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Furthermore, the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 triggered a similar response in the reconstituted RIPK3-KO but not the caspase-8/RIPK3-DKO macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). No aggregation of RIPK3 was observed when poly(I:C) or zVAD were added to the cells alone, but GSK'872 was able to induce RIPK3 aggregation in RIPK3-KOâRIPK3-GFP cells when added alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Stimulation of RIPK3-KOâRIPK3-GFP cells with poly(I:C) plus zVAD for 45 or 180âmin followed with or without ATP treatment did not change the pattern of RIPK3-GFP aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). There were only fewer cells that formed RIPK3-GFP aggregates at 45âmin compared with 180âmin after stimulation, indicating that RIPK3 recruitment to the TRIFâRIPK1 complex starts as early as 45âmin after stimulation with poly(I:C) plus zVAD. Consistent with the lack of RIPK3 involvement in the intermediate pathway, stimulation of RIPK3-KO-RIPK3-GFP cells with poly(I:C) for 45âmin followed by ATP treatment in the absence of zVAD did not result in any RIPK3-GFP aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Combined, these results indicate that caspase-8 is physically required for oligomerization of RIPK3 downstream of TLR3 and TRIF, as well as by binding of GSK'872 to RIPK3.</p>
        <p>To provide additional evidence that direct oligomerization of RIPK3 can induce NLRP3 activation we ectopically expressed a chimeric protein composed of RIPK3 or RIPK3-ÎRHIM fused to two copies of FKBP<sup>F36V</sup> (RIPK3-2xFV or RIPK3-ÎRHIM-2xFV, respectively)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> in a 293T cell line stably reconstituted with procaspase-1, ASC and NLRP3 (293T-C1AN cells), or a 293T cell line stably reconstituted with only procaspase-1 and ASC (293T-C1A cells). Treatment of the RIPK3-2xFV cells with the homodimerization drug AP20187 led to activation of caspase-1 in 293T-C1AN cells, but not in 293T-C1A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). There was no caspase-1 activation in the ÎRHIM expressing cells after a similar treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Similar results were obtained when these constructs were stably expressed in 293T-C1AN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).

However, poly(dA:dT) required prior LPS priming to induce efficient caspase-1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>, seventh to tenth lanes). DRP1-KO macrophages also showed normal inflammasome activation by the early, intermediate and late pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9aâd</xref>).

        <p>As FADD/caspase-8 signalling plays an important role in activation of the inflammasome by extracellular dsRNA we asked whether it plays a similar role in inflammasome activation by transfected dsRNA.

      <p>TLR signalling is one of the most important signalling events that regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, the critical proteins downstream of TLRs that are involved in NLRP3 priming and activation and their exact role in this process have not been fully elucidated. Caspase-8 is an important component of TLR signalling. It is recruited by both TLR3 and TLR4 to induce apoptosis and regulates NF-ÎºB activation and necroptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Recent studies provided conflicting results on its role in NLRP3 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Studies in caspase-8/RIPK3-DKO macrophages revealed that loss of caspase-8 inhibits NLRP3 priming and activation by both canonical and noncanonical stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Similar results were also reported in FADD/RIPK3-DKO macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In contrast, studies in caspase-8-cKO DCs showed that loss of caspase-8 facilitates LPS-induced NLRP3 activation through the RIPK3 necroptotic pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. To address these conflicting results we assessed the activity and assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome during the early and late events of TLR signalling in cells containing or lacking caspase-8 activity. We used caspase-1 processing and ASC polymerization assays, which allow direct readout of inflammasome assembly in response to TLR signalling in the absence of new protein synthesis. We particularly avoided the widely used IL-1Î² secretion assay as a readout of inflammasome activation because this assay requires priming of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for 4â6âh to transcriptionally induce proIL-1Î². This prolonged priming with LPS can desensitize both the MyD88 and TRIF pathways and can also lead to transcriptional induction of genes that may affect inflammasome assembly, which could complicate analysis of the individual contribution of MyD88, TRIF and other downstream signalling molecules to the post-translational events that regulate inflammasome assembly.</p>
      <p>Our results show that signalling downstream of TLRs can regulate NLRP3 activation via three post-translational pathways depending on the adaptor molecules engaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10a</xref>). The early pathway is triggered by recruitment of the adaptor molecule MyD88 to TLRs, which in turn recruits IRAK4 and IRAK1 to post-translationally prime NLRP3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In this early pathway, caspase-8 or its adaptor molecule FADD does not appear to play a critical role, as no defect is observed in activation of NLRP3 by the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 plus ATP in FADD/caspase-8-deficient macrophages. In contrast, FADD/caspase-8 appear to be critical for an intermediate pathway of post-translational NLRP3 priming, which is controlled by the adaptor molecule TRIF downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The intermediate pathway can be clearly detected following treatment with ATP 30â60âmin after poly(I:C) stimulation of TLR3. This pathway also requires RIPK1 but not RIPK3 or the enzymatic activity of caspase-8. Our assays of ASC polymerization revealed that inflammasome assembly occurs normally after stimulation of TLR3 with poly(I:C) in the presence of the potent pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD, indicating that caspase-8 plays a scaffolding role rather than a proteolytic enzyme in NLRP3 activation by extracellular dsRNA plus ATP and that its enzymatic activity is not important for NLRP3 activation under these conditions.</p>
      <p>Physiologically, the MyD88-dependent early pathway plays a critical role in the rapid activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by gram-positive bacteria such <italic>L.monocytogenes</italic> and possibly others such as <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which can secrete NLRP3-activating toxins and stimulate the MyD88 simultaneously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, our data suggest that the intermediate pathway might also serve to enhance inflammasome activation in conditions of co-infections with dsRNA viruses such as rotaviruses and pathogenic bacteria that produce NLRP3-activating toxin such as <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Clostridium difficile.</italic> Indeed, co-infection with rotaviruses and toxin-producing bacteria are frequently observed in conditions of acute gastroenteritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The synergistic effect of dsRNA produced by rotaviruses on inflammasome activation might be responsible for the more severe clinical presentation and inflammation observed in these conditions.</p>
      <p>Caspase-8 scaffolding function does not appear to be limited to post-translational priming of NLRP3 during the intermediate pathway. Our results indicate that caspase-8 scaffolding function controls yet another distinct late pathway of NLRP3 activation that can only be detected under conditions in which caspase-8 enzymatic activity is compromised. In this pathway ASC polymerization is observed 3â4âh following stimulation with poly(I:C) and zVAD. Importantly, although this late pathway of inflammasome activation requires a longer period of stimulation (3â4âh), it does not require new gene expression indicating that it is activated by a post-translational modification mechanism. Furthermore, this late pathway does not require exogenous signal 2 (for example, ATP), indicating that it can simultaneously provide a priming signal (signal 1) and an activation signal (signal 2) to facilitate assembly of the inflammasome.</p>
      <p>Our analysis of the late pathway revealed that it is controlled by both RIPK1 and RIPK3 as loss of either RIPK1 or RIPK3 leads to inhibition of inflammasome assembly during this phase. As RIPK1 and RIPK3 are critical mediators of the necroptotic pathway, it is likely that the late pathway of inflammasome activation is induced by activation of the RIPK3âMLKL necroptotic pathway. Consistent with this possibility, the kinase activity of RIPK3 is critical for activation of NLRP3 by the late pathway. Like RIPK3-KO macrophages, RIPK3 kinase-dead macrophages or WT macrophages treated with the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 exhibited a defect in activation of NLRP3 by the late pathway. Importantly, both RIPK3 kinase-dead and RIPK3-KO macrophages were unable to activate NLRP3 through the late pathway in the presence or absence of signal 2 (ATP), suggesting that the kinase activity of RIPK3 is critical for providing both signal 1 and signal 2 in this pathway. As the late pathway can be activated by poly(I:C) plus zVAD without the need for stimulation of the P2X7 receptor with ATP, it follows that the RIPK3 kinase activity somehow can induce potassium efflux (signal 2) through the cell membrane, an event critical for NLRP3 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. How RIPK3 can induce potassium efflux and also provide a priming signal (signal 1) in the late pathway is currently unknown, but it is likely that phosphorylation of MLKL by RIPK3 can induce potassium efflux by stimulating the pore-forming activity of MLKL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Consistent with this possibility, genetic deletion of MLKL resulted in inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by the late pathway.</p>
      <p>RIPK3-GFP expressing macrophages showed clear RIPK3 aggregation into speck-like structures after stimulation with extracellular dsRNA only when caspase-8 activity is compromised, but not in the absence of caspase-8, indicating that the physical presence of inactive caspase-8 is a critical step in the recruitment and oligomerization of RIPK3 by TLR3 signalling. The physical presence of inactive caspase-8 was also required for assembly of the inflammasome in these cells. Intriguingly, RIPK3 aggregation by the RIPK3 kinase inhibitor GSK'872 was also dependent on the physical presence of caspase-8, but caspase-8 inhibition was not required (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Indeed, this inhibitor recruits caspase-8 to the inhibited RIPK3 by stimulating binding of RIPK3 to RIPK1 and FADD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. This certainly raises the possibility that the scaffolding function of caspase-8 together with its catalytic activity is also important for RIPK3-induced apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Our observations suggest that caspase-8 physically nucleates RIPK3 oligomerization in response to the RIPK3 kinase inhibitor GSK'872, or in response to TLR3 signalling when its caspase activity is compromised.</p>
      <p>LPS stimulation has been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in caspase-8-cKO DCs in the absence of exogenous signal 2 (ATP) in a RIPK1âRIPK3âMLKL-dependent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Similarly LPS stimulation combined with inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP) inhibition by SMAC mimetics, IAP deletion or A20 deletion can all lead to RIPK3-dependent inflammasome activation in the absence of exogenous signal 2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). LPS plus IAP inhibition appears to trigger two RIPK3-dependent inflammasome activation pathways in the absence of exogenous signal 2; one is dependent on MLKL when caspase-8 is inhibited and the other is dependent on caspase-8 activity when MLKL is deleted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Our findings demonstrate that dsRNA can activate NLRP3 without exogenous signal 2 only in the presence of inhibited caspase-8 through the TRIFâRIP1âRIP3-dependent late pathway. This late pathway is dependent on MLKL and might be similar to the pathway that is activated by LPS and IAP inhibitors when caspase-8 is inhibited. In addition, this pathway might also be similar to the pathway activated by LPS in caspase-8-cKO DCs, which is also dependent on MLKL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. As the scaffolding function of caspase-8 is required for aggregation of RIPK3 and activation of NLRP3 by poly(I:C) and zVAD, it is likely that it is also required for activation of the inflammasome by LPS and IAP inhibitors when caspase-8 is inhibited, and by LPS in caspase-8-cKO DCs. As Cre-Lox recombination does not totally eliminate caspase-8 expression in caspase-8-cKO DCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, it is likely that the remaining caspase-8 has very low protease activity because of binding to cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein, but is sufficient to provide a scaffolding function for the assembly of the RIPK1âRIPK3âFADDâcaspase-8 complex.</p>
      <p>Caspase-8 is also important for NLRP3 inflammasome activation by cytoplasmic dsRNA in WT macrophages but not in RIPK3-deficient macrophages. This suggests that RIPK3 blocks inflammasome activation at the level of the cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10b</xref>). Caspase-8 activity might be required to relieve this inhibition by cleaving RIPK3 or another regulator of RIPK3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Cytoplasmic dsRNA can activate the inflammasome independent of TRIF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, RIPK1 or RIPK3, or their kinase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). In fact, inhibition of RIPK3 kinase activity with GSK'872 or mutating the kinase domain as in the RIPK3-KD macrophages enhances cytoplasmic dsRNA-induced inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c,d</xref>). As both GSK'872 and mutation of the kinase domain of RIPK3 enhance caspase-8 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> likely by enhancing the oligomerization of RIPK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), these observations suggest that sensing of cytoplasmic dsRNA by their putative sensor leads to assembly of a FADDâcaspase-8 complex that regulates RIPK3 association with, or inhibition of, this sensor. The future identification of this cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor should shed more light on how it regulates NLRP3 activation.</p>
      <p>Our findings are in conflict with a recent report proposing that the mitochondria fission regulator DRP1 is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation by cytoplasmic dsRNA and RNA viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Our results show clearly that DRP1-KO macrophages have no defect in inflammasome activation in response to TLR3 stimulation, cytoplasmic dsRNA or VSV. Moreover, our findings suggest that VSV-induced NLRP3 activation is only partially dependent on RIPK3 suggesting that VSV can utilize an additional pathway to activate the inflammasome. This conflict is likely due to the use of different systems. Whereas in this study we used macrophages from conditional DRP1-KO mice, the previous study used siRNA-knockdown experiments.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results provide a detailed picture of the multiple signalling pathways activated by foreign RNA to control NLRP3 activation and the central roles played by the FADD/caspase-8, RIPK3 and MLKL complexes in these pathways. Future investigation of the mechanism of NLRP3 activation by extracellular and intracellular dsRNA should shed more light on these intricate pathways.</p>

        <title>Schematic representations of the TLR and cytoplasmic dsRNA pathways that regulate NLRP3 activation.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Three pathways downstream of TLRs are involved in priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The early MyD88-dependent pathway provides a priming signal 1 downstream of TLR2, whereas the intermediate TRIF-dependent pathway provides a priming signal 1 downstream of TLR3. Both of these pathways require exogenous signal 2 from purinergic receptors or pore-forming toxins for activation of NLRP3. Signal 2 is required to induce potassium efflux. The late TRIF-dependent pathway can provide both signal 1 and an endogenous signal 2 by recruiting RIPK3 and MLKL when caspase-8 is inhibited. (<bold>b</bold>) In WT macrophages, FADD/caspase-8 complex is required to remove RIPK3 inhibition of the cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor. In RIPK3-deficient macrophages such as Casp8/RIPK3-DKO macrophages, caspase-8 is not required for activation of NLRP3 by dsRNA sensor.</p>
