      <abstract>
        <p>Schistosomiasis is a common debilitating human parasitic disease in (sub)tropical areas, however, schistosome infections can also protect against a variety of inflammatory diseases. This has raised broad interest in the mechanisms by which <italic>Schistosoma</italic> modulate the immune system into an anti-inflammatory and regulatory state. Human dendritic cells (DCs) show many phenotypic changes upon contact with <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> soluble egg antigens (SEA). We here show that oxidation of SEA glycans, but not heat-denaturation, abrogates the capacity of SEA to suppress both LPS-induced cytokine secretion and DC proliferation, indicating an important role of SEA glycans in these processes. Remarkably, interaction of SEA glycans with DCs results in a strongly increased expression of Suppressor Of Cytokine Signalling1 (SOCS1) and SH2-containing protein tyrosine Phosphatase-1 (SHP1), important negative regulators of TLR4 signalling. In addition, SEA induces the secretion of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and the surface expression of the costimulatory molecules Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) and OX40 ligand (OX40L), which are known phenotypic markers for the capacity of DCs to polarize naïve T cells into Th2/Treg cell subsets. Inhibition of mannose receptor (MR)-mediated internalization of SEA into DCs by blocking with allyl α-D-mannoside or anti-MR antibodies, significantly reduced SOCS1 and SHP1 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SEA glycans are essential for induction of enhanced SOCS1 and SHP1 levels in DCs via the MR. Our data provide novel mechanistic evidence for the potential of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> SEA glycans to modulate human DCs, which may contribute to the capacity of SEA to down-regulate inflammatory responses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Parasitic helminths (worms) have evolved to suppress inflammatory responses of the immune system to survive in their hosts [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Interestingly, these properties have equipped them with the capacity to reduce the severity of inflammatory diseases within that host [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Evidence from epidemiological studies indicates an inverse relationship between the incidence of helminth infections and the occurrence of immune-related diseases including allergies, multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model for MS, eggs of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, a parasitic trematode bloodfluke, reduced disease severity in established disease, while pre-established infection with live <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> delayed onset and significantly reduced incidence of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In TNBS and DSS colitis models, two mouse models for IBD, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> was shown to ameliorate colitis [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and infection with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> has beneficial effects in collagen-induced arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>The effect of helminths to reduce the severity of inflammation within their host has been attributed to their capacity to modulate the host’s immune response. A key cell type in this pathway is the dendritic cell (DC), which is an antigen-presenting cell that plays a central role within the immune system in determining the type of effector T cell response via the recognition of pathogen-derived or self-antigens. DCs are well equipped to govern the development of naïve T helper (Th) cells towards Th1, Th2, or regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotypes, depending on the information that is received from sampled antigens. LPS-activated DCs polarize naïve T cells towards a Th1 response, by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 12 (IL-12). On the other hand, infection with helminths like <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> leads to Th2 and Treg responses, driven by DCs among other cells, via the increase in IL-10 and/or transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) levels, and surface expression of specific costimulatory molecules like Programmed Death Ligands (PD-L1/2) and OX40 ligand (OX40L) [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. DCs acquire immune regulatory functions by interaction with pathogens, including helminths, via various pattern-recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study we focus on defining molecular mechanisms that contribute to the suppression of inflammatory responses of human DCs by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> soluble egg antigens (SEA). Several studies have shown that production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by TLR-stimulated human DCs is markedly reduced in response to direct contact with SEA [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We have shown previously that SEA-primed human DCs induce a Th2 response <italic>in vitro</italic>, associated with increased expression of OX40L on DCs in the presence of LPS [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Interestingly, Omega-1, a major component of SEA, can condition DCs into an anti-inflammatory phenotype with potential to induce a Th2 response, which is proposed to occur mainly via its RNase action [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other compounds within SEA include IPSE/α-1, which has been shown to induce IL-4 production [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Kappa-5 [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], however many compounds are still unidentified. DCs stimulated with miracidial fluid secreted by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> inhibit human T lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], indicating a reduction of the strength of the immune response. The underlying mechanism(s) by which SEA modulates human DCs, however, are still incompletely understood and likely include multiple SEA components and pathways.</p>
      <p><italic>In vivo</italic> mouse models have shown that the glycosylation of SEA is essential for its ability to induce anti-inflammatory Th2 responses [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. SEA is recognized and internalized by human DCs via several CLRs, including DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), the mannose receptor (MR) and macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), important receptors for internalization of glycosylated antigens and intracellular signaling upon binding of specific glycans [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Some major components within SEA have been identified that bind these CLRs. Omega-1 and IPSEα1, which both contain Galβ1-4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc (Lewis X, Le<sup>X</sup>) motifs on diantennary N-glycans [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], interact with DCs mainly via the MR, whereas Kappa-5 interacts with all three CLRs [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has been shown that after internalization of Omega-1 in the DCs by the MR, its RNase activity contributes to an anti-inflammatory DC phenotype by reducing protein synthesis via RNA breakdown [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recent data show that SEA contains components that suppress TLR-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression via DC-SIGN by activation of NF-κB family member Bcl3 [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, multiple components and mechanisms seem to play a role in immune modulation of DCs by SEA.</p>
      <p>Using total SEA we here provide novel mechanistic evidence that SEA glycans contribute to the induction of an anti-inflammatory phenotype in human DCs.</p>

        <title>Monocyte isolation and generation of human immature dendritic cells</title>
        <p>Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors (commercially obtained from Sanquin, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) or fresh blood of healthy volunteers, who gave written informed consent. Blood samples were collected from volunteers by a qualified technician. The authors had no interactions with the volunteers, and have no access to identifying information regarding the volunteers. The Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) does not apply to this study and an official approval of this study by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of VU University Medical Center is not required. The Medical Ethics Review Committee of VU University Medical Center is registered with the US Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) as IRB00002991. The FWA number assigned to VU University Medical Center is FWA00017598.</p>
        <p>Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using CD14 microbeads (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and differentiated into immature DCs in the presence of 250 IU/ml IL-4 and 120 IU/ml GM-CSF.

To oxidize glycan moieties, SEA was treated with sodium periodate (PI) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. SEA was denatured (DN) by incubation for 20 min. at 80°C, then immediately cooled on ice and stored at -20°C until use. Endotoxin contamination was determined in all samples by Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate assay (Charles River Laboratories, Leiden, NL). Contamination was lower than 1 ng/ml endotoxin for all preparations. The SEA preparation used does not contain detectable levels of LPS in functional assays in DCs and TLR-reporter cells, tested as described [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

        <p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> SEA has previously been shown to modulate DC maturation, including the suppression of TLR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, in a concentration dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which SEA acts on human DCs are incompletely understood. To discriminate between possible glycan- and RNase-mediated effects of the helminth antigens, SEA was either heat-denatured (DN) to abolish RNase activity, or periodate (PI) treated, to oxidize glycan structures [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To confirm the effectiveness of PI treatment, the binding capacity of different CLRs to the treated SEA preparations was measured. PI treatment caused loss of binding by the recombinant CLR-Fc hybrids MGL-Fc, DC-SIGN-Fc and MR-Fc to SEA (<xref rid="pone.0124089.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), indicating that the glycan ligands for these CLRs were destroyed by PI treatment. By contrast, heat treatment (DN) of SEA did not affect lectin binding, indicating the presence of intact glycan ligands on the heat-treated antigens. Heat treatment did, however, abolish the capacity of SEA to degrade RNA (<xref rid="pone.0124089.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating that RNase activity was destroyed, whereas PI treatment did not destroy the RNase activity within SEA. The mild DN and PI treatments did not result in precipitation or loss of SEA proteins, as indicated by SDS-PAGE analysis of the final sample (<xref rid="pone.0124089.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>After establishing the efficacy of both heat and periodate treatments, human DCs were pulsed with treated and untreated SEA in the presence of LPS, and their immunomodulatory capacities were analysed. The results in <xref rid="pone.0124089.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> establish that secretion of the LPS-induced cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), IL-6 and IL-12p70 by DCs was suppressed by SEA and show that this suppression was not significantly affected by heat-treatment of the antigens, indicating that RNase activity does not significantly contribute to the observed effects. In contrast, PI treatment of SEA did abolish its ability to suppress these cytokines (Fig <xref rid="pone.0124089.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0124089.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).

The enhanced OX40L expression induced by SEA in the presence of LPS was inhibited by either heat-treatment or PI-treatment (<xref rid="pone.0124089.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), indicating the importance of both an intact glycan and protein structure here.

        <title>SOCS1 and SHP1 are not induced upon contact of DCs with immobilized <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> SEA</title>
        <p>In regard to the mechanism by which SEA negatively regulates TLR4 signaling, we hypothesized that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> SEA has to be recognized and internalized by lectin-receptors present on DCs to suppress the cytokine production from LPS-activated DCs, and/or to enhance expression levels of SOCS1 and SHP1. To test this possibility, SEA was presented to DCs either soluble in the culture medium, or immobilized to a plate to prevent internalization. Immobilization of SEA resulted in loss of its capacity to suppress the LPS-induced production of TNFα and possibly IL-12p70 in DCs, whereas suppression of IL-6 production remained unaltered (Fig <xref rid="pone.0124089.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0124089.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). In addition, immobilization caused a complete loss of the expression of both SOCS1 and SHP1 (Fig <xref rid="pone.0124089.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124089.g004" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). These data show that a complete loss of induction of both SOCS1 and SHP1 expression is associated with a loss of suppression of TNFα, but not IL-6 production, indicating a difference between the regulation of expression or secretion of these cytokines. In addition, these data suggest that uptake of SEA by DCs is required for their ability to suppress LPS-induced TNFα production and to enhance SOCS1 and SHP1 expression.</p>

        <title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> SEA-induced SOCS1 and SHP1 expression is reduced by blocking its interaction with the MR</title>
        <p>SEA has previously been shown to be internalized via the glycan binding CLRs DC-SIGN, MGL and MR [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that induction of SOCS1 and/or SHP1 may depend on internalization of SEA by DCs via interaction of SEA-associated glycans with one or more of these CLRs. To evaluate this possibility, SOCS1 and SHP1 mRNA levels were determined in DCs pulsed with either PI-treated or untreated SEA. Interestingly, PI treatment of SEA resulted in a reduced mRNA expression of SOCS1 and SHP1 (<xref rid="pone.0124089.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), indicating that SEA glycans contribute to the enhanced expression of both genes. To further establish a role for SEA glycans in SOCS1 and SHP1 expression, we investigated glycans that could inhibit the binding of DCs to SEA, thereby possibly also inhibiting SEA-induced SOCS1 and/or SHP1 expression. Since DC survival was affected by using high concentrations of free monosaccharides, necessary to enable blocking of DC binding to SEA, we tested a panel of potentially more potent monosaccharide derivatives for their ability to inhibit binding of DCs to SEA. We found that the mannose-derivative allyl α-<sc>d</sc>-mannoside (AllMan) inhibited the binding of DCs to SEA at low concentrations, in contrast to methyl α-D-mannoside (MeMan) (<xref rid="pone.0124089.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, AllMan also inhibited SEA-induced SOCS1 and SHP1 expression by DCs, whereas MeMan did not show inhibition at a similar concentration (<xref rid="pone.0124089.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Incubation of DCs with AllMan or MeMan alone did not alter expression levels of SOCS1 or SHP1. These results establish that specific SEA-associated glycans are essential for the induced SOCS1 and SHP1 expression in DCs, possibly via interaction with a CLR with mannose-specificity. To further test the specific involvement of CLRs, we then tested whether AllMan could block the binding of DC-SIGN-Fc and/or MR-Fc, both mannose/fucose recognizing CLRs [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], to SEA. We found that low concentrations of AllMan blocked binding of both MR-Fc and DC-SIGN-Fc to SEA (<xref rid="pone.0124089.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>), whereas higher MeMan concentrations were needed to achieve a partial suppression of MR-Fc and DC-SIGN-Fc interaction with SEA.</p>

        <p>To discriminate between the putative involvement of DC-SIGN and the MR in the SEA-induced expression of SOCS1 and SHP1, DCs were incubated with blocking antibodies for the MR or DC-SIGN prior to SEA stimulation. The data indicate that the blocking antibodies to MR, but not isotype control antibodies, significantly inhibit SEA-induced SOCS1 and SHP1 expression. By contrast, blocking of DC-SIGN did not affect SOCS1 and SHP1 expression (Fig <xref rid="pone.0124089.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124089.g005" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). In addition, we determined whether blocking the MR or DC-SIGN using similar concentrations and conditions as described above, could prevent the potential of SEA to suppress LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, we were unable to find a significant effect (data not shown), suggesting that a more complete block of the MR, or a contribution of other yet unknown factors, is required for an effective suppression of cytokine production. In summary, these data indicate that SEA glycans are essential to induce expression of SOCS1 and SHP1 in human DCs via interaction with the MR.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Several studies by our group and others have shown that production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by DCs is markedly reduced in response to direct contact with helminth antigens [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In mouse models it was shown that oxidation of the glycans of SEA, which contains many glycoproteins, affected the capacity of SEA to induce a Th2 response, indicating the involvement of SEA glycans in this process [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We here set out to determine the role of glycan determinants of SEA in the modulation of LPS-induced activation of human DCs and subsequent T cell proliferation. Recently it was shown that Omega-1, a major glycoprotein in SEA, can polarize DCs into a Th2 promoting phenotype, which was attributed to both the glycosylation and RNase action of Omega-1 [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To discriminate between putative glycan-mediated effects of SEA and effects associated with RNase activity, we subjected SEA to either mild periodate treatment to oxidize glycan structures and thus destroy their integrity, or heated the SEA for 20 min at 80°C to denature protein structures thereby abolishing RNase activity. Our data revealed that PI-sensitive SEA glycans regulate important properties of human DC function. Such glycans contribute to the suppression of the LPS-induced secretion of TNFα, IL-6 and IL-12 by DCs, whereas heat-treatment of these products abolished RNase activity, but did not affect the observed suppressive properties of SEA. Importantly, we show that PI treatment of SEA, but not heat-treatment, reduced the capacity of SEA-primed DCs to induce T cell proliferation. The data presented here show that RNase activity is not a dominant factor within total SEA in its contribution to the described anti-inflammatory properties in DCs, whereas periodate sensitive glycans of SEA do play a significant role.</p>
      <p>The novel finding that SEA increases the expression levels of SOCS1 and SHP1, known negative regulators of TLR4 signalling, provides insight into the mechanisms by which SEA suppresses TLR4-induced DC activation [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. SOCS1 belongs to a family of proteins that inhibits the cytoplasmic JAK/STAT signalling pathway induced in TLR signalling, and has been shown to be of crucial importance for the limitation of inflammatory responses [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. SHP1 is part of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family and has been reported to play a role in the negative regulation of TLR-mediated immune responses, including those induced via TLR4 [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Remarkably, deficient macrophage SHP-1 expression has been observed in MS patients, and is correlated with an enhanced inflammatory phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The induction of negative regulators of TLR signalling may be a strategy of pathogens to limit pro-inflammatory responses. Recently, elevated SOCS3 levels were observed in SEA-treated DCs [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and elevated SOCS1 expression was observed in HIV- and <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic>-infected patients [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our data show that SEA strongly increases SOCS1 mRNA levels in human DCs. Whereas posttranscriptional regulation plays an important role in maintaining the stability of SOCS1 protein [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], our data show enhanced SOCS1 protein levels in DCs at 1h after addition of SEA, and these levels are maintained for several hours. This indicates that SEA induces significant levels of stably expressed SOCS1 protein. In addition, SHP1 mRNA and protein levels are induced by stimulation of DCs with SEA under similar conditions as SOCS1 activation. Our data also reveal that the capacity of SEA to induce SOCS1 and SHP1 is glycan-dependent, since both oxidation of SEA glycans and blocking the binding of SEA to DCs by adding the mannose-mimic AllMan inhibit the induction of SOCS1 and SHP1 expression. Remarkably, SEA induces a simultaneous upregulation of SOCS1 and SHP1 in all assays, indicating that co-regulation of both negative regulators may occur. It has been demonstrated that SOCS1 can contribute to SHP1 function in the negative regulation of cytokine signalling, and that loss of SOCS1 can significantly compromise the ability of SHP1 to down-regulate STAT5 activation [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>
      <p>The involvement of SEA glycans in the modulation of DC function implicates a role for one or more lectin receptors on DCs. CLRs are known to internalize soluble glycoconjugates, and are able to induce intracellular signaling cascades, thereby enhancing or suppressing TLR signal transduction routes [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We have shown previously that DCs internalize SEA via the CLRs DC-SIGN, MGL and the MR [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that SOCS1 and SHP1 induction can be blocked both by the mannose derivative AllMan and by anti-MR antibodies indicating that the SEA-induced expression of SOCS1 and SHP1 in DCs is MR-mediated.</p>
      <p>The MR is an endocytic receptor and cross-linking of the MR can enable the induction of an immunosuppressive phenotype in DCs [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], although no intracellular signaling motif has been found in its cytoplasmic tail [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The MR has previously been shown to play a significant role in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>-induced modulation of pro-inflammatory responses in murine macrophages via internalization of excretory/secretory material released by cercariae [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The mechanism by which the MR induces SOCS1 and SHP1 expression is yet to be determined. The capacity of SEA to upregulate mRNA levels of SOCS1 and SHP1 via the MR is difficult to associate with RNase activity of Omega-1. It would be possible though that Omega-1 or Ipse/α-1, which show similarity in their glycosylation and are both internalized via the MR, could induce the upregulation of these negative regulators via their glycans, but it should be noted that more glycoproteins are present within SEA that, based on their glycomic profile [<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124089.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], could be candidates for recognition and internalization by the MR. Although blocking SOCS1 and SHP1 expression with anti-MR Ab or AllMan resulted in a significant reduction of SOCS1 (~60%) and SHP1 (~40%) expression, we did not observe a significant reduction in the suppression of TNFα production of LPS-activated DCs. Possibly, the MR blockade by antibody is not sufficiently efficient to obtain an effect on the level of cytokine secretion, since a complete block of both SOCS1 and SHP1 expression by immobilization of SEA did reverse the suppression of TLR4-induced TNFα production. Alternatively, internalization of SEA via multiple receptors may be required to act in concerted action to induce expression of SOCS1 and SHP1 effectively. In addition, it is possible that multiple compounds of SEA can down-regulate the TLR4-induced cytokine production via different pathways, thereby acting as back-up systems for each other.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results show that periodate sensitive glycans of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> SEA are essential for suppression of TLR4-induced pro-inflammatory responses in human DCs. SEA induces many phenotypic changes in DCs which are associated with anti-inflammatory properties, whereas RNase activity within SEA is not a dominant factor to condition DCs to suppress TLR4-induced cytokine production and T cell proliferation. In addition, our data provide novel insights in the mechanisms by which SEA glycans act and implicate a crucial role of the MR in the SEA-induced upregulation of SOCS1 and SHP1 expression in DCs. This may contribute to the capacity of SEA to down-regulate inflammatory responses in its host by modulation of adaptive T cell responses.</p>
