        <p>Maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity and minimizing neuronal injury are critical components of any therapeutic intervention following ischemic stroke. However, a low level of vitamin D hormone is a risk factor for many vascular diseases including stroke. The neuroprotective effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 (vitamin D) after ischemic stroke have been studied, but it is not known whether it prevents ischemic injury to brain endothelial cells, a key component of the neurovascular unit. We analyzed the effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on brain endothelial cell barrier integrity and tight junction proteins after hypoxia/reoxygenation in a mouse brain endothelial cell culture model that closely mimics many of the features of the blood-brain barrier <italic>in vitro</italic>. Following hypoxic injury in bEnd.3 cells, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment prevented the decrease in barrier function as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance and permeability of FITC-dextran (40 kDa), the decrease in the expression of the tight junction proteins zonula occludin-1, claudin-5, and occludin, the activation of NF—<italic>k</italic>B, and the increase in matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. These responses were blocked when the interaction of 1,25(OH) )<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) was inhibited by pyridoxal 5’-phosphate treatment. Our findings show a direct, VDR-mediated, protective effect of 1,25(OH) )<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> against ischemic injury-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction in cerebral endothelial cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke are among the main causes of death and disability in industrialized countries. A large number of studies have shown that cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury causes structural and functional breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), resulting in increased BBB permeability [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and the extent of disruption is directly correlated with the severity and duration of the insult [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. BBB breakdown not only facilitates brain edema and hemorrhage, but has also been linked to an increase in the expression of various cytokines and chemokines, predisposing the brain to a secondary cascade of ischemic injury. Following a brain injury, rapid protection against BBB disruption would be a critical component of any therapeutic intervention to minimize secondary neuronal injury.</p>
      <p>The BBB regulates the transport of molecules to the central nervous system and restricts permeability across brain endothelium [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tight junction (TJ) proteins are the most prominent feature of brain endothelium for maintaining BBB integrity and a critical component of the paracellular pathway, which is vulnerable to ischemic injury [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many studies using <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB models have shown that hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induce an increase in BBB permeability and/or TJ disturbance [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Factors leading to BBB disruption during and after stroke include alteration in intracellular calcium, production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and increased production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. ROS contribute to brain injury by inflicting damage on proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, as well as by activating a number of redox-sensitive signaling pathways. Many laboratories have shown that the production of ROS influences BBB permeability through the upregulation of cell-disrupting enzymes and protein complexes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<italic>k</italic>B), VEGF and activator protein 1 (AP-1), among others [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Vitamin D is a steroid hormone synthesized in human skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol by UV light, and is primarily metabolized in the liver and then in the kidney into calcitriol (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>). Calcitriol is the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D and an FDA-approved molecule whose neuroprotective and neurotrophic actions are being increasingly recognized, and it may prove to be a candidate intervention for stroke. Calcitriol exerts steroid-like effects throughout the body, directly affecting the expression of multiple genes [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR). While 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> has classically been associated with systemic calcium homeostasis, there is now substantial evidence that it is also a potent modulator of the immune system that can regulate inflammation, neuromuscular function, cell-cycle control, and neuroprotective functions by regulating neurotrophin production [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) are independently predictive for fatal strokes, while 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> deficiency exacerbates experimental stroke injury in rats [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the neuroprotective effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> after ischemic stroke are well documented, less is known about the effects of vitamin D and its underlying mechanisms on brain endothelial cells after hypoxic injury.</p>
      <p>We do know that the actions of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> are mediated primarily by the VDR, a member of the nuclear receptor family [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Vitamin D has been shown to exert its immuno-modulatory activity on both mononuclear and polynuclear cell lines through its effects on the VDR [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The important role of the VDR in mediating the effect of vitamin D has been demonstrated in VDR-knockout mice, in which cardiomyocytes developed cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in the face of this depletion.</p>
      <p>Using bEnd.3 cells as an <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB model, we investigated the effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and the role of the VDR in BBB permeability, cerebral endothelial cell death, and increased production of ROS-induced NF-<italic>k</italic>B—MMP-2/9 expression after H/R. Previous studies have found brain endothelial cells to be a suitable <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB model for studying TJ protein and gene expression, sucrose permeability, transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), and solute transport [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This model allowed us to study the mechanisms of action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> by directly testing the effects of the VDR antagonist pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (P5P) (the active form of vitamin B), which in <italic>in vivo</italic> testing could have confounding mechanistic effects independent of the VDR [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We hypothesized that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> blocks NF-<italic>k</italic>B-mediated hypoxia-induced BBB disruption and cerebral endothelial cell death by binding to the VDR, and this beneficial effect is blocked by P5P. Our findings in this study show that the hormonal form of vitamin D can play an important role repairing BBB damaged by stroke.</p>

      <p>Several lines of evidence show that vitamin D hormone has neuroprotective effects following ischemic brain injury [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but the role of vitamin D and the VDR in H/R-induced BBB permeability has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we found that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> attenuated H/R-induced TJ loss and therefore membrane permeability by blocking the increased production of ROS, NF-<italic>k</italic>B activation, and MMP-9 expression. These protective effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> were blocked by treatment with the VDR antagonist P5P. The genomic action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, is mediated through the interaction of the VDR with vitamin D response elements (VDRES) from the target genes [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>To investigate the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on BBB function after H/R, we monitored TEER and FITC-dextran permeation, the typical and widely used markers for measuring <italic>in vitro</italic> functionality of BBB TJs and permeability, respectively, in bEnd.3 cells after 6-h hypoxia and 3-h reoxygenation [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, TEER values dropped and FITC-dextran permeation across the BBB increased. We found that adding 1,25(OH)2D3 prevented the decrease of TEER and the increase of 40 kDa FITC-dextran. P5P blocked these effects (<xref rid="pone.0122821.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>), suggesting that they are VDR-mediated. To the best of our knowledge the present study is the first to show the role of the VDR in modulating BBB permeability. Our results suggest that VDR modulation can be targeted as a possible therapeutic intervention for restoring BBB permeability following ischemic insult.</p>
      <p>TJs play an important role in preserving BBB integrity under various pathological conditions.</p>
      <p>A number of studies have indicated that hypoxia and H/R lead to disruption of BBB TJs in <italic>in vitro</italic> models of the BBB [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We and others have previously shown that claudin-5 and occludin expression is highly susceptible during ischemic events and also correlates with TEER changes in brain endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The literature also reports a reduced level of ZO-1 following hypoxic exposure [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], a finding consistent with our current ZO expression results as measured by immunocytochemistry (<xref rid="pone.0122821.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The observed TJ alterations in our experiment may have been caused by the loss of ZO-1. Because cytoplasmic ZO-1 is linked with actin filaments and the transmembrane protein claudin-5 [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], impairment of the actin filaments may lead to a loss or alteration of ZO-1 and claudin-5. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0122821.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, the loss of TJ proteins after H/R in bEnd.3 cells was prevented by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment, and blocking the VDR by P5P diminished the beneficial effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. These results can be taken to suggest that this VDR-mediated effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is associated with stabilization of the TJ complex.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that BBB disruption can start with focal damage to the vascular wall which then results in endothelial cell apoptosis caused by plasma proteins such as CD8+ T lymphocytes, granzyme B and amyloid-β. Endothelial apoptosis is also induced by cytokines including TGF-β1, platelets and ROS <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Here we found that H/R in bEnd.3 cells induced a marked decrease in cell viability (apoptosis), and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment prevented this effect through its actions on the VDR (<xref rid="pone.0122821.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
      <p>Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the molecular mechanisms of BBB dysfunction through regulation of TJ proteins in hypoxic injury, including ROS generation, oxidative stress, upregulation of MMPs, cytokines and VEGF, and activation of Rho kinase and myosin light chain kinase [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. ROS-inducing oxidative stress is a cellular signaling mediator for various molecules such as glutamate [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], cytokines, and growth factors released from activated glia or microglia [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which in turn have been associated with activation of NF-<italic>k</italic>B [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These findings led us to investigate the inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on H/R–induced mitochondrial superoxide and intracellular hydrogen peroxide. It has been proposed that mitochondrial ROS are a major factor in BBB impairment in ischemia followed by reperfusion [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Here, we found that brain endothelial cells exposed to H/R display elevated ROS production and this is decreased by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment (<xref rid="pone.0122821.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Treatment with P5P and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> blocks that beneficial effect.</p>
      <p>Hypoxia-induced activation of NF-<italic>k</italic>B observed in various cell types is known to be mediated through the phosphorylation of I<italic>k</italic>B [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It has been suggested that the intracellular ROS level regulates NF-<italic>k</italic>B activity, but the molecular mechanism involved remains unclear [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In most unstimulated cells, the inactive p65 component of NF-<italic>k</italic>B is retained as dimers in the cytoplasm that are bound to I<italic>k</italic>B proteins. After stimulation, I<italic>k</italic>B proteins are phosphorylated and targeted for degradation <italic>via</italic> the proteasome pathway, allowing the translocation of the p65 component of NF-<italic>k</italic>B to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of IkB in Ser32 and Ser36 of the N-terminal leads to ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis and results in the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus, followed by the activation of specific target genes [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> prevents the translocation of p65 into the nucleus and the phosphorylation of I<italic>k</italic>B after H/R in bEnd.3 cells, and that the effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on reduction of NF-kB activity is mediated through the VDR (<xref rid="pone.0122821.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Our results are in line with the data of Tse et al. showing reduced NF-<italic>k</italic>B transcriptional activity after 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment in VDR-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our data indicate that the VDR is required for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> action on NF-<italic>k</italic>B, an observation supported by Janjetovic et al., who found that 20-hydroxy-vitamin D<sub>3</sub> did not affect I<italic>k</italic>Bα mRNA levels in keratinocytes lacking the VDR [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
      <p>Several studies have demonstrated that the proteins regulating TJ proteins such as Rho and MCLK induce the activation of the gelatinases MMP-2/9, which contribute to BBB disruption in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Increased MMP-2 and/or -9 has also been examined in <italic>in vitro</italic> endothelial cells after hypoxia and H/R [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. MMP-2/9 is mainly produced by injury stimulators such as inflammatory cytokines, serine proteinases, transcriptional factors, and free radicals during reperfusion in ischemic stroke. MMP-2/9 has been shown to mediate BBB disruption by degrading TJ proteins such as occludin and claudin-5 in an animal stroke model and an <italic>in vitro</italic> ischemic model [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], using the selective MMP-2/9 inhibitor SB-3CT or its neutralizing antibodies, showed that MMP-2 released in medium is the major enzyme mediating oxygen glucose deprivation-induced occludin degradation. In contrast, in our study we observed that exposure of the bEnd.3 monolayer to hypoxia for 2 h significantly increased MMP-9 but not MMP-2 expression. This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that we evaluated the expression of MMP-2/9 in the cell population as opposed to the cell media used in the Liu et al. study. MMP-2 is responsible for early BBB disruption, while MMP-9 is involved in brain injury at relatively late stroke stages <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Based on the results reported here, we think that the increased membrane permeability after 6-h hypoxia/3-h reoxygenation is caused by increased MMP-9 expression rather than by membrane disruption.</p>
      <p>The effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on MMP-2/9 expression in bEnd.3 cells after hypoxic injury have not been previously reported. Treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> prevented the hypoxia-induced increase of MMP-9 expression. Interestingly, blocking of the VDR with P5P eliminated this effect (<xref rid="pone.0122821.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on MMP-9 expression after hypoxia may be explained by the inhibiting action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on ROS production and NF-<italic>k</italic>B activation.</p>
      <p>Increased vascularization or vascular protection following ischemic/reperfusion injury may be critical to mediate functional recovery, with endothelial cells being the primary cell type responsible for angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. While the beneficial role of angiogenesis in stroke is recognized [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], there is considerable evidence from the cancer literature suggesting that high doses of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and its analogs inhibit cellular proliferation and angiogenesis and stimulate the apoptotic process [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. While inhibition of tumor invasiveness and angiogenesis by vitamin D is reported to be mediated by inhibition of MMPs, VEGF, and parathyroid hormone-related protein [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], vitamin D has also been reported to stimulate angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells by increasing VEGF expression and pro-MMP-2 activity [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. VEGF activation has been shown to be beneficial at a later stage of stroke by enhancing angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], but in the acute stage, it is also known to increase microvascular permeability, causing increased edema and hemorrhage [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our study shows that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> protects against ischemic injury-induced BBB dysfunction in cerebral endothelial cells by protecting them from ROS and proinflammatory cytokines. The differential effects of vitamin D in cancerous and normal tissue merits further investigation.</p>
      <p>In stroke, early disruption of the BBB appears to be a major risk factor for hemorrhagic complications and edema formation induced by treatment with tPA, currently the only FDA-approved stroke drug [<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122821.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Overall efficacy for tPA reperfusion therapy could be increased and risk-to-benefit ratio reduced by preventing endothelial cell injury and BBB breakdown associated with tPA treatment. Although a more detailed <italic>in vivo</italic> study in stroke models with vitamin D is necessary, our <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggest to us that the neurovascular protective effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment may prove an important adjunct strategy to improve the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapies such as tPA.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we found that treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> prevented BBB disruption through VDR-dependent mechanisms in cerebral endothelial cells subjected to H/R (<xref rid="pone.0122821.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These results show a direct protective effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> against ischemic injury <italic>in vitro</italic> in cerebral endothelial cells and help to define a novel mechanism for VDR-mediated protection. Given the critical role of endothelial cells for proper brain function, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> protection against cerebral endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting ROS production and NF-<italic>k</italic>B activation provides a mechanism to explain the neuroprotective effects of vitamin D hormone.</p>

          <title>Schematic presentation of a possible mechanism of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> action on hypoxia-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption.</title>
          <p>Following hypoxic injury, an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which further leads to intracellular oxidative stress (1). As a result, damaged mitochondria activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways, causing IkB proteosomal degradation <italic>via</italic> phosphorylation of IkBα (2), which leads to proteolysis and the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (3). The attachment of NF-κB subunits to its DNA binding site modulates MMP-9 transcription, which leads to increased MMP-9 expression (4). Increased expression of MMP-9 mediates BBB disruption (low TEER values) through degradation of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 (5). 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> blocks the signaling cascade by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (6) and preventing the translocation of p65 into the nucleus and the phosphorylation of I<italic>k</italic>B (7). The VDR antagonist pyridoxal 5’-phosphate blocks the effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on BBB markers (8).</p>
